<h2>THE LAUGHING BEAR&mdash;or
MOUWOU THE DELIVERER.</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="72" height="75" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A long</span> time ago at Seoul, the capital of
Korea (now under the control of
Japan), lived a king and queen who had
a little daughter called Chonwa.</p>

<p>The little princess grew in the sunshine of her
parents' love, until she reached the age of eight.
Then it was announced that, according to the custom
of her country, her betrothal was to be arranged
by the state. The mother led her into the
beautiful garden and tried to show the perplexed
girl why the rules of the court required that a king's
child should be married for the sake of the country.</p>

<p>So fixed were their minds on this subject, that
neither of them noticed a dark, fierce-looking man
creeping after them. None but a very bold man
would have dared come thus into the king's private
grounds. He followed with fierce glances every
movement of the innocent pair. When the queen
and her child sat down on a bench to watch a turtledove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
drink at the fountain, the man crawled toward
them with a long knife in his teeth. He was
almost upon them, when the queen happened to
see him. Before she could even cry for help, the
ruffian stabbed her twice.</p>

<p>Courageously, the little princess sprang upon
the man and scratched his face. He drew back
from the unexpected attack, then rushed at the defiant
little maiden, seized her by the waist, and carried
her off in his arms.</p>

<p>Just as he reached the gate, he was stopped by
an encounter that he little expected&mdash;he found
himself face to face with an ugly, grinning bear.</p>

<p>The man placed his frightened burden on the
ground, then reached for his bloody knife, and
sprang at the huge bear. The bear sat up, still
grinning. When the man came near enough, she
struck him such a blow on the head that he went
sprawling to the ground, and the knife flew out of
his hand.</p>

<p>The man lay where he had fallen, with his ashen
face turned toward the setting sun. Bruin
waddled over to him and pushed him with her nose
to see if he would move. He showed no sign of
life. Then the bear turned and tried to pull the
princess by the sleeve toward the palace. Chonwa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was not at all afraid of her rescuer and followed
her willingly.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when they were met by
the king's guards, who came rushing toward them
in frantic haste. The child hesitated between them
and her rescuer, but when the captain laid hold of
her, the bear turned and trotted away.</p>

<p>Chonwa told her father and his court of the
attack and the rescue, but only the guard believed
the bear part of the tale; and when, after a long
hunt, no trace of bear or robber was found, the
king dropped the whole affair.</p>

<p>The queen mother had a long illness, from
which her recovery was hastened by the sight of
her darling daughter, whom she had given up as
lost.</p>

<p>The princess never forgot her shaggy deliverer,
but looked daily for her return. Time passed
rapidly at the court, and it did not seem long till
four years had rolled away. By this time, according
to the custom of her nation, Chonwa, though
only twelve years old, was considered ready for
marriage.</p>

<p>She was taken into the inner palace and clothed
like a woman. A hateful "chan-ot" or veil was
put over her face so that boys could not see her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Her only playmate was a harsh old governess who
scolded her all the time, so that poor Chonwa often
wished herself dead.</p>

<p>Among her former boy friends was a young
prince, whom Chonwa considered her best playmate.
One day she stole from the palace, unseen
by her governess, and met this boy-prince whose
name was Mousan. They were found out, and
two days later the young prince was banished and
Chonwa was betrothed to a sixty year old prince,
whom she had never seen. Her protests were all
in vain, for it was considered an honorable marriage
arranged by the state for the benefit of the
people of Korea. Imagine Chonwa's misery when
she beheld her betrothed. His name was Hamkieng,
which made one think of "dead pig." He
looked like a pig, too, and snored loudly even in
the daytime, when he was not being amused.
When he walked he waddled like a very fat porker.
Chonwa cried for days, but she could not stop the
marriage arrangements, and at last the wedding
day arrived.</p>

<p>The palace was beautifully decorated, and the
guests were all assembled. Just as the king gave
the command for the ceremony to begin, a loud
growl was heard coming from the entrance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
priest stopped his preparations and fled. No wonder,
for at that instant came into the room the great
bear, Chonwa's friend! The queen fainted, and
the king in trying to help her stumbled headlong
over her. Prince Hammie&mdash;so they called him
at the court&mdash;drawing his sword, made an awkward
thrust at the beast, who raised a great paw,
and smote him on the head, rolling him over and
over like a barrel. By this time the company
had scattered and hid!</p>

<p>The princess was delighted to see her old
friend, and she gave Bruin a tight hug. The guests,
venturing from their hiding-places, were more astonished
than before. Still more were they amazed
to see Chonwa bestride the grinning bear and
ride out of the palace! Out into the garden she
rode, past the soldiers, down the busy street and
into a neighboring forest.</p>

<p>The king and queen were wild with grief, and
the unlucky Hammie, chagrined at his bride's escape,
bit his long finger nails. A reward was offered
for the head of the old bear, and the hand of
the princess was promised to the young man who
should bring Chonwa safely home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Chonwa dismounted in the forest,
she became aware of a young man coming toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
her. He was dressed in white and carried a
black broad-brimmed hat. Chonwa at once recognized
Mousan, the banished prince!</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," said the prince, "how
thankful I am to find you; I have waited all these
months wondering what had become of you!"</p>

<p>Bruin gathered the two thankful children in
her arms and, opening her mouth, began to talk.</p>

<p>"My dear Chonwa," she began, "I have come
to bring you to a land more beautiful than any
you have ever imagined, where play is as work
and work is as play. We shall proceed to the
Eastern mountains and then trace the beautiful
river Nak-tong-kang to the sea, finally to settle
down in a wonderful home by ourselves."</p>

<p>But her words of comfort were interrupted by
the appearance of a funny-looking fat man. His
eyebrows were so long that he had them braided,
and they hung over his ears like spectacles. Between
his thumb and finger he held a highly polished
stone. He explained that he was Hu-Mok,
the Stone Doctor, who could cure all diseases.</p>

<p>The bear growled, but Chonwa begged the
Stone Doctor to cure her eyes, which had been
weakened from wearing the veil. Whereupon he
slapped his knees and held the stone before her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
gaze. Suddenly the girl felt a peculiar dizziness.
She felt her eyes getting larger and larger, and
the Doctor kept getting bigger and bigger&mdash;and
then she knew no more; she had fainted.</p>

<p>Mousan caught her as she fell, and the bear lifted
her right paw and smote the Doctor a heavy
blow. He went sprawling to the grass and his
stone lodged in a nearby tree. It took some time
to revive the girl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Doctor had recovered sufficiently
to sit up. He was a pitiful-looking object.
His eyes were bloodshot and his hair stood up as if
he had had a bad dream. "Oh, give me my stone!
Oh, give me my precious stone! Oh!" moaned the
doleful old quack.</p>

<p>Mouwou growled, showing her great white
teeth and raising her terrible paw, at which he became
silent.</p>

<p>But so angered was Mousan by the false Doctor's
wicked trick, that he rushed upon him, grabbed
his eyebrow whiskers, and dragged him off
howling.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the two disappeared from view
of the others, than the quack sprang like a tiger
upon the young prince and bore him to the ground;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
then he placed his hand upon the boy's mouth to
prevent him from yelling for help.</p>

<p>"Now!" hissed the furious Hu-Mok, who was
twice as strong as any ordinary man, "I shall teach
you a thing or two!" Mousan struggled to escape,
but the strong one planted a heavy foot on his
neck and kept it there till he was senseless. Cautiously
the villain looked around lest some one
should see, then dragged his victim to his den.</p>

<p>When the princess had revived completely, the
bear persuaded her to mount her back again. Bruin
at this time had not guessed that there was anything
wrong with her other charge; so when the
princess asked her where Mousan was, she merely
replied that he had gone to punish the Doctor.</p>

<p>They had not gone very far when they saw a
snake charming a little bird. The bird could not
move from its perch, but stood screaming and flapping
its wings in terror. The old bear rushed at the
reptile and struck it a deadly blow. At once the
grateful bird flew to its rescuers. It perched upon
the shoulder of the girl and rubbed its smooth feathers
against her cheek, while the snake wiggled
away to die.</p>

<p>So this queer trio passed through the woods,
the bird on Chonwa's shoulder and the girl on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
bear's back. They were surprised and delighted
when they came to a little thatched shanty on
which was a sign with the words, "Rest for the
Weary."</p>

<p>"Do let us rest here till Mousan catches up!"
begged eager Chonwa. She dismounted, approached
the house, and peered in. There she
saw, to her delight, a beautiful woman lying on
a couch reading.</p>

<p>She knocked gently and the woman came out
smiling, and holding a glass of wine. Chonwa
was very thirsty but when she was about to take
the drink, the woman opened her mouth, and behold,
a cloven tongue darted out!</p>

<p>Chonwa dropped the glass and fled in fear.</p>

<p>The woman was the serpent come to life again.
The instant Chonwa saw her mistake the woman
changed back into the snake and began to pursue
her.</p>

<p>The bear was some distance away and so could
not help her charge. The snake was almost upon
the princess, when the little bird flew with all its
strength against the open mouth of the reptile. By
flapping its tiny wings in the serpent's eyes, the
bird prevented it from biting. But the frail rescuer
received the blow intended for Chonwa, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
fell to the ground in great agony, though it was
not seen by the others.</p>

<p>Mouwou quickly arrived at the scene of danger.
Angry as fire, she smote the snake a terrible
blow on the head, crushing it. Then, unable to
find the gallant bird, the two went on.</p>

<p>Finally they came to a very pretty resting place
by a brook that gurgled and sang a sweet song all
day and all night. Like a good mother, the bear
placed the tired girl on a patch of moss and sang
her to sleep.</p>

<p>When Chonwa awoke she was much refreshed,
and at once inquired about Mousan.</p>

<p>The bear, too, had been worrying about the
prince. To the princess she said: "Do not be
afraid&mdash;I'll go in search of him. Stay right in this
spot, and do not believe everything that you hear."
So saying, she lumbered out of sight.</p>

<p>No sooner had the bear-mother gone than the
little wounded bird came crawling toward the
maid. "I am dying, dear friend," it sobbed, "and
I want to see you before I go. You have been so
good to me!" Then the bird's voice became faint,
and its eyes opened wide as in a death-stare.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" sobbed Chonwa. "You must not
die! You saved my life." But the bird was past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
saving, for the poison was doing its work quickly.</p>

<p>At that instant, a voice was heard calling
sweetly: "Mushrooms! Mushrooms! Sure cure
for all diseases. This way, gentle girl. I can help
you. See how delicious."</p>

<p>Chonwa saw a strange little humpbacked man.
He was scarcely three feet tall. His face looked
old, but his voice was like that of a little choir-boy.
In a dish he carried about a dozen mushrooms.
They were hot and had been roasted in butter and
salt, and they filled the air with a fragrance that
made Chonwa's mouth water.</p>

<p>But she, remembering how the woman had
fooled her, was afraid.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Chonwa.</p>

<p>"I am a great cook," said the man, bowing low.
"I have cooked for your father many a time. You
have tasted my dishes before. I am now cooking
for the queen of the forest. See, princess, just
try it on that little bird. My cooking acts like medicine."</p>

<p>With Chonwa's consent, he thrust a little particle
down the bird's throat. The bird revived instantly
and stood up and chirruped with delight.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the mushrooms were poison. The
hunchback was Mikado, the snake-woman's slave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and the mushrooms were the wicked woman turned
into food. As poison cures poison, the poisoned
mushrooms had acted as an antidote and the bird
was saved. But the child not knowing the laws
of chemistry, believed that the mushrooms were
good food, as well as fine medicine, so she helped
herself to the appetizing dainties. Soon she felt
drowsy and laid herself down. The hunchback
kicked his heels in the air and danced with joy. "I
am saved!" he shouted. He had been promised a
straight back, such as he had before he followed
the evil woman, if he could succeed in destroying
one life.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! My back will soon be straight," he
sang out. "Ha! Am I not clever? Already I feel
my hump getting&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Straight!" growled Mouwou, who at that moment
appeared. Her tongue hung out, red with
heat, and her breast was covered with flaked foam.
Her eyes blazed fire and her voice sounded like the
rumbling of thunder.</p>

<p>The cook's tune of mirth was instantly changed
to wails for mercy. His hair stood on end, his
jaws relaxed, and his eyes almost swelled out.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the bear. "I'll straighten you, miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cook!" She lifted her huge paw and brought
it down with terrible force upon the hump.</p>

<p>"Ouch! Ouch!" yelled the dancer, as his hump
pushed through and thrust out before him. He was
hump-chested now!</p>

<p>"There!" said the bear. "Henceforth, you'll
follow your hump. You won't have to carry it on
your back any more!"</p>

<p>While Mouwou was dealing with the cook, the
little bird was furiously picking at Chonwa's swollen
neck. She picked and picked until a hole was
made in the skin. Immediately a snake ran out
and disappeared in the grass. Mouwou turned
to the princess and began to scratch her arm. Several
snakes fell out and the bear killed them.
Again and again she scratched, till more than
twenty snakes had come out and been killed.</p>

<p>The princess was soon entirely well. As it
was growing dark, the mother made a cozy bed of
leaves and bade her good night. With a prayer
for the safety of Mousan. Chonwa fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning, just before they started on
their hunt, the bird took a little flight to exercise
its wings. It returned with the information that
the hunchback was lying not far away in much
pain. Following the bird, Chonwa and the bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
found the hunchback rolling on the ground, apparently
too weak to stand. He thought his head had
been twisted round, because he could see his hump,
a thing he never could do before! He had spent
the greater part of the night in rolling over and
over trying to twist his head so that the back would
be where the face was. When he saw the bear,
he begged her to untwist him.</p>

<p>"I'll twist your pin-head for you, you rascal,"
she said, "if that is all that you want!"</p>

<p>So saying, with one wrench she turned his
face around till he was really looking backward.</p>

<p>The man rose to his feet with great difficulty
and proceeded to walk, but to his astonishment
he walked backward. His feet went the usual
way, but as his head was looking backward, he
could not see where he was going, and he bumped
into a tree. He tried to walk the way his nose
pointed and he fell again and again. At last he
gave it up and sat down.</p>

<p>He was more confused than ever to find himself
buckling up in the way opposite to that to
which he had been accustomed. Finally, down
he went as his body would have it, and he found
his nose against the tree instead of the back of his
head. Sobbing loudly, he took his head in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hands and wept tears down the back of his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear bear, cure me!" he moaned, "I am
a miserable sinner and I deserve it all! But please
give me a chance, and I shall do better in the
future! Never again shall I associate with that
snake woman! Never! I want to be good!" This
was the very thing that the bear wanted, for it was
very hard for her to seem so cruel to one in such
pain.</p>

<p>The little princess, who had been crying, nodded
approvingly at the bear, who immediately
caught the man in her arms and righted his head to
the proper place. Then she laid him on the ground
and with one great whack made him a straight man
again.</p>

<p>The wicked snake-woman had bent him in
making him do her bidding. Now that he was
well, he became a convert to the new life, and was
added to the company of three. He volunteered
to guide them to the house where the Doctor lived.</p>

<p>They started none too soon to look for Mousan,
who at that time lay bound in a horrible den some
distance off. After the quack had deposited the
prince in his own cave, he went in search of his
precious stone, which he quickly found. He returned
in great glee to the cave. Entering, he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
on a low stool facing the boy, who was bound so
that he could not move.</p>

<p>The Doctor then called for his pipe, and a horrid
lizard crawled toward him with the pipe in its
mouth. Then the man called loudly for his tobacco,
and a great turtle crawled forward with it on
his back.</p>

<p>Slowly the Doctor filled his pipe and lighted it.
At the first puff his mouth was filled with dirt from
the foul pipe, and he jumped in the air, yelling
loudly. He landed on the turtle and slipped. In
his anger, he kicked the lizard and jumped again
and again upon the turtle's back, at which the turtle
seized him by the leg. It was a grand mix-up
for a few minutes. The prince could not help
laughing, and once started he laughed till the tears
rolled down his face.</p>

<p>Finally the Doctor freed himself from the turtle
and rushed to the boy.</p>

<p>"You are laughing, eh!" he exclaimed, shaking
his fist at Mousan. "I shall soon have you
silenced!"</p>

<p>From his pocket he took his polished stone,
which he placed in the prince's mouth. In a few
minutes the boy was completely paralyzed. With
eyes wide open and his hearing gone, he lay rigid
all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>At break of day the quack came to his side and
said: "Young man, I have made up my mind to
teach you my art&mdash;on one condition. My work
on earth is to make all men as miserable as possible.
When I see a man at the height of his ambition,
I step in and compel him to make a fool of
himself, and down and out he goes. Ha! If I cannot
ruin him that way, I tell something nasty about
him to some deluded soul, who spreads the news
to the mob, and presto! my man is done for.
Again, I like to throw a microbe into the stomach
of a healthy person and watch him squirm.
Come, join me and I will teach you the art of the
magic stone."</p>

<p>Freed from the spell, at the Doctor's will, the
boy sat up and stretched his arms. But he shook
his head to the proposal.</p>

<p>"Very well, then!" said the angry quack. Then
he fastened about the prince's neck a chain attached
to a pole, and left the cave.</p>

<p>At once a great swarm of ants came running
toward the boy. He fought them off till he fell exhausted
to the floor, his body covered with the
nipping insects. The pain of a thousand bites
made him feel that his end was near, and he closed
his eyes, praying for death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The quack came again and offered him freedom,
if he would become one of his followers. The
prince made no reply; so his tormentor sat down
to enjoy the sight of his dying victim.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cave was darkened. The Doctor
turned and saw the bear! Staggering to his
feet, he fled to an inner recess. Like a flash the
bear rushed over the ants, freed the boy from his
chains, carried him out, placed him upon the green
grass, and began to lick his wounds.</p>

<p>In a few moments the prince opened his eyes,
and upon the arrival of the princess and the little
man, he was smiling. Water was brought from
a nearby stream and Mikado washed Mousan's
body and limbs.</p>

<p>"Mikado," said the bear, "I am going to find
the quack and get his magic stone. Please look
after things while I am gone. I'll cure the boy with
the rascal's magic!"</p>

<p>In a few minutes the bear returned, holding in
her paw the glistening stone. "Now," said she,
"let all wish that the prince may become well
again; and you, my dear Mousan, look at this
stone."</p>

<p>They did so and Mousan recovered immediately.
The poor boy could scarcely believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
he was well again and that his dear Chonwa was
with him.</p>

<p>Then Mouwou gathered the children in her furry
embrace.</p>

<p>"I am glad to have both of you alive with me
this day, and that I can speak to you now knowing
that you will understand. Obedience is the law
of all creation, and he that disobeys will come to
a very bad end. All the pain that you have witnessed,
and some that you have endured, has come
from disobedience to the law of kindness. But
we shall forget the past and only think of the
future. I have the Doctor's stone, and by this we
shall be able to undo all the evil conjured up by
that miserable fellow. The man himself I marked
with a "Q," meaning quack, so that all who see
him may know the truth. Come, let us be going
to the great South Country."</p>

<p>The four picked up the trail and proceeded to
the Land of Sunshine and Joy, ever obedient to
the old bear.</p>

<p>The prince and the princess were married
when they grew up, and lived very happily to ripe
old age; and the rest of the story you will find
written in the annals of Korea.</p>

<h2>THE GRAY WITCH</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="75" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">In</span> a city of which you all know the name
lives a little girl who formerly was very
naughty but now behaves much better
than she did. This little girl was very
beautiful, which made it seem all the more sad
that she ever was naughty.</p>

<p>One day she was particularly bad and would
do nothing to please anybody. She wanted to be
petted, waited upon, and humored all the time.
She fretted and whined so much, that when evening
came, her mother was no longer able to endure
her behavior, and sent her to bed immediately after
supper.</p>

<p>As she lay dozing in her little cot, she remembered
that she had not said her prayers. She would
not get out of bed to say them, but muttered in a
peevish voice: "I wish that God would punish all
the wicked people I know! But there's no use
praying anyway!"</p>

<p>No sooner had little Polly uttered these words,
than a light flashed upon her astonished eyes. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sat up in bed and gazed in horror. Coming toward
her was an old, stooped, wild-eyed woman, dressed
in gray and carrying a big stick.</p>

<p>Polly tried to scream, but her voice seemed no
louder than the squeak of a mouse. Then she tried
to get out of bed and run to her mother, but could
not move a foot, nor even a finger. Meanwhile the
hag came nearer, and as she approached she grew
more ugly.</p>

<p>Polly was already nearly dead with terror; yet
what did the old woman do but reach her heavy
hand and lift the child by her hair right out of bed!
Then the frightful hag let her fall upon the floor,
gave her a hideous look, and sharply commanded:
"Follow me, pouter!"</p>

<p>In vain did Polly try to resist. Clad only in
her nightdress, she followed her unwelcome guide
out of the house. The night was cold, and the
streets were muddy. After they had tramped about
for a while, the witch stooped lower than ever and
made Polly bestride her back; then she flew with
her little rider to the Mountains. Here the hag
stopped, and placing the child on the ground, commanded
her to wish.</p>

<p>Poor Polly was afraid to speak.</p>

<p>"Ask! Ask!" the witch kept repeating, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
stood over Polly, shaking her long bony hand at
her. "I give you five minutes to decide! Going&mdash;going&mdash;gone!"</p>

<p>At the last word the old woman clapped her
hands together, making sparks fly.</p>

<p>Polly screamed with terror: "I only want to
be good! Please!"</p>

<p>Then, for a long time, Polly remembered no
more. Everything became dark, and she thought
she was getting smaller and smaller, until suddenly
she became a pin-point and pricked herself, as if
she had been somebody else!</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed as she came to herself
again. She looked about, and saw beautiful mountains
all around. The valley in which she lay was
green with grass and glowing with beautiful wild
flowers. Not far off she could see a clear, sparkling
river. She was clad in a new and lovely pink
frock with stockings and shoes to match. What did
it all mean?</p>

<p>The sun was already high in midheaven. As
far as Polly's eyes could see, the scenery was entrancing.
Birds sang in the branches, and squirrels
ran to Polly and begged for nuts.</p>

<p>Then she heard the shout of little children, and
saw twenty or more youngsters frolicking in a near
meadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>When the children saw her they ran to meet
her and made her very welcome. Soon she became
quite at home among them.</p>

<p>Finally a little boy named Harry pointed with
his finger; "See, it is dinner-time!" he said.</p>

<p>Polly looked where the boy pointed and was
astonished to see a tall, stately clock-tower, rising
high above all the mountains. The hands of the
clock pointed to twelve.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed Polly. "Isn't it grand?
Why didn't I notice it before?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Harry, "you were playing and
not thinking about time."</p>

<p>At that instant the clock struck twelve. Then
it chimed forth a sweet chant, more beautiful than
anything that Polly ever had heard. It made her
feel as though she were in heaven. But being still
a child of earth, she clapped her hands and scampered
off with the other children to the tower.</p>

<p>"How often, Harry, does that clock chime?"
asked Polly.</p>

<p>"It plays music every quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"How is it, then, that I did not hear the music
before?"</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that you have not heard
the clock chime all the morning? It has been playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
right along. You must have seen that we children
stopped playing for a few seconds now and
then. At those times we were listening to the
music."</p>

<p>The other children gathered about Polly, and
when Harry told them about her failure to hear
the chimes, they all began to laugh.</p>

<p>Polly could not bear to be laughed at so she
cried bitterly; whereupon the other children scampered
off.</p>

<p>Harry, however, tried to comfort the weeping
child. "Polly," he pleaded, "never mind those
children; they do not know any better."</p>

<p>Polly suddenly drew away from him. "I guess
you told them things about me! Go away from
me! You are a tattle-tale!"</p>

<p>She stamped her foot, and her eyes flashed.
Harry turned and walked away sadly.</p>

<p>Suddenly to Polly all nature became very still
and lonesome. She was sorry that all the children
had gone, and she did not know where to find
them. The great clock-tower too had disappeared.
She began to be afraid once more. Sitting down
on a stone she almost wished herself dead. No
one loved her. The sun began to move toward
the West and Polly was beginning to feel hungry
as well as sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>But now occurred something that made her
forget all about hunger: She saw the witch approaching
her, looking more horrid than ever.
When Polly tried to run, she found herself so badly
frightened that she could not move from the spot.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please, good woman," pleaded
Polly, falling on her knees, "don't take me away
from these fields. I know I was naughty, but I
will try to do better in the future. Please&mdash;don't
take me away!"</p>

<p>Instead of scolding and threatening, as Polly
feared, the hag gently patted her on the head, saying:
"So you want to stay here. My child, no
one can stay here who wishes evil and is stubborn."</p>

<p>"I'll be good&mdash;I'll be good," pleaded Polly.</p>

<p>"Then, child, you shall have your wish," replied
the old woman, disappearing from the scene.</p>

<p>As soon as the witch was gone, Polly rose from
her knees and wished for Harry, but wishing did
not bring him. Feeling tired after so much excitement,
she lay down and peacefully drifted into
dreamland.</p>

<p>She was aroused by Harry's voice.</p>

<p>"Polly! Polly!" he was gently calling until
she opened her large blue eyes. "It is past dinner-time,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
he said, "and if you do not hurry there will
be no good things to eat."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, Harry!" she cried. "I have been
very, very naughty!"</p>

<p>Happily they walked toward the great clock
tower, which had become visible again to Polly.
She afterward learned that her vision changed with
her mood. In this land, if she was cranky and
irritable she saw snakes and toads and worms and
other creeping things, while if she was good she
saw only singing birds and laughing waters and
other beautiful objects.</p>

<p>When the two entered the hall, most of
the other children were leaving. Polly followed
her friend to a seat and began to enjoy the good
things on the table.</p>

<p>After they had eaten, Harry led her about the
building and showed her its many wonders. They
were about to leave when Polly discovered a picture
that startled her. It appeared to be a large
painting of two children, walking together, and
an old hag dragging after.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry!" exclaimed Polly, starting back,
"it is the picture of the gray witch! Come, let us
run!"</p>

<p>She turned to flee but Harry caught her. "Yes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>,
Polly," he said in surprise, "it is the witch, but
she is not ugly but beautiful. If you knew her
you would like her. She loves all of us very
dearly. It is she who gave you that fine dinner!"</p>

<p>"I do not believe it! She is horrid&mdash;I hate her!"
shouted Polly. "She is always scolding me."</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken, Polly. She is the
kindest woman in all the world!"</p>

<p>Polly turned to look at the picture again. It
had changed. The girl was a saucy little minx, but
the boy was full of grace and beauty. The witch
was smiling.</p>

<p>"Why," whispered Polly, "that boy looks like
you! But how wild the little girl looks! The witch
is smiling. I never saw the old thing look like that
before."</p>

<p>"It is not a painted picture at all," said Harry,
"but only a mirror."</p>

<p>"Oh," screamed Polly, turning round to find
the witch. But the old woman was gone. Polly
glanced at the mirror again, and there stood the
two children alone.</p>

<p>"I hope the witch did not hear what I said
about her," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>They left the building and wandered along a
pretty green carpeted road. A fat goose with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
brood of goslings waddled after them, gabbling
something that sounded like this: "Wait for us!
We want to go too. My little children cannot walk
so fast. Hold on! Hold on there!"</p>

<p>Polly stopped and beckoned to the old thing.
Immediately the mother with her group of children
came to her. She said that her goslings were
the finest children in all the land. "Why," she
said, "they walked as soon as they were born! Not
like humans, who have to be nursed and cradled
for years before they know anything. My children
began to do for themselves when they were
an hour old. Now humans are stupid till they are
taught a trade with which to earn a living. There
are no idle children among my youngsters."</p>

<p>"I have always heard people say 'as foolish as
a goose,'" replied Polly. "I am never going to say
that again, for I see that I was mistaken. I should
have said 'as stupid as human children!'"</p>

<p>When all were rested they started off to the
half-mile creek to see the big bullfrogs.</p>

<p>"Now watch, Polly," said Harry, when they
reached the banks, "and you will see the great
prince of the frogs. He comes out about this
time of the day to review his subjects. There is
the band coming already. Like other monarchs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he likes to be preceded by a great swell of music.
The people of Frogdom must be impressed."</p>

<p>Sure enough, there swam into view a company
of frogs, big and little. They swam to a little
island and leaped up the bank. The leader, who
was a little larger than the others, faced them and
waved a small twig. Immediately the frog band
struck up.</p>

<p>It was a strange band indeed. They had all
the parts, from the bass up to a high treble. The
water trombones sat breast deep in the water so
that they produced a very delightful music. Others
stood on their toes and rubbed themselves against
the tall grass to produce a violin effect. The big
frogs played bass; the little fellows shrilled like
piccolos.</p>

<p>The children clapped their hands and sang to
the accompaniment of the frog band. The old
goose swung her head from side to side, keeping
time with the music, while the goslings sang all of
the tunes they knew. When the band played a
familiar cake-walk, they waddled about the bridge
as gracefully as goslings could, with their necks
joined together.</p>

<p>Suddenly the band ceased, and the children beheld
a very large bullfrog sitting on a pond lily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
drawn by eight little frogs. Dreamily the car of
state floated toward the little island.</p>

<p>"It is the king," whispered Harry.</p>

<p>The big lazy frog landed at the island, followed
by a great host of froggies. Then he stood
up and his subjects bowed low. When the band
struck up the national anthem of Frogdom, all the
frogs cheered and waved their hands. Then they
had games and contests to please his majesty.
Some turned somersaults, some in swimming races
made wonderful time, while others strutted on
their hind legs to see who could do it longest.</p>

<p>The old goose was very much annoyed at the
haughty ways of the frog king, and she muttered
something about people making too much of themselves.
"I would like to teach that fat fellow that
he is better able to draw those little frogs than
they are to draw him!" she declared as she jumped
into the water and swam to the island.</p>

<p>As soon as she reached shore, she waddled up
to the king, who was addressing his subjects. Nobody
noticed her approach and their astonishment
knew no bounds when she appeared among them
hissing loudly. The king was so startled that he
broke down in his speech, and his subjects lost no
time in diving deep into the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The ruler was left alone and defenseless. The
goose seized him by his fat sides, and swallowed
his majesty. The king was no more. His bereaved
subjects wailed, and the band played a
mournful tune, as they saw their monarch disappearing,
inch by inch, down the long neck of the
goose.</p>

<p>Mrs. Goose turned upon the crowd. "You simpering
loons!" she hissed, "what are you mourning
over? A lost king? No, but over your own stupidity.
Now you are free and I advise you to set
up no more monarchs; if you do, I shall turn my
goslings loose upon you." So saying she swam
back again and waddled about on the bridge.</p>

<p>After this exciting incident the children took
off their shoes and paddled in the cool stream. Polly
was delighted to feel the little fishes nibbling at
her toes. When this enjoyment was at its height,
they were surprised to see a little man gliding toward
them in a little boat. He came paddling
against the stream, singing as he dipped the blade
into the water. He was a handsome fellow and
sat bravely in his wee cockleshell.</p>

<p>"Get in my children," he said. "I have been
sent to bring you to the great palace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," protested Polly, "the boat is no longer
than my own body."</p>

<p>"Nothing can be accomplished without trying,"
said the little boatman, so they stepped in and
instead of sinking, the boat rose just a little out of
the water. It was certainly a magic boat. And
when the boatman plied his paddle the little vessel
skimmed like a swallow along the surface. Upstream
they glided, passing under many bridges.
It was the most delightful trip that Polly had ever
taken.</p>

<p>Just below the landing was a bend in the
stream and as they rounded it a magnificent landscape
suddenly popped into view. A splendid
building stood close to the landing. It was known
as the River Castle. As the children sprang out,
a merry group of youngsters came running to meet
them. An acquaintance began at once, and soon
Polly and Harry were playing with the other children
as if they had known one another for years.</p>

<p>By and by there was a lull in the play, and Polly's
eyes wandered to the great tall building. She
had not carefully observed the high eight-sided
tower, whose top was lost to view in the clouds.
Its sides were set with bell-shaped disks, made of
different metals&mdash;some of gold, some of silver, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
others of copper. As the light of the setting sun
shone upon them, the scene was beyond description.</p>

<p>"What is that?" whispered Polly grasping an
arm of her friend, and pointing toward the castle.</p>

<p>"That is the great reflector. Every sound that
has ever been made is repeated here," explained
Harry. "Even the growing corn may be heard
singing as it grows."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the striking of the
old town-clock. They counted the strokes&mdash;one,
two, three, four, five. They seemed many miles
away.</p>

<p>"It is the old clock in the tower," whispered
Polly.</p>

<p>The disks took up the sweet notes and magnified
them till they sang a thousand times more
sweetly. Then the chimes struck up their beautiful
music. The children stood with bowed heads
as they heard the grand harmonies of heaven.</p>

<p>When the music had ended, the boy and the
girl sat silent for many minutes. Then Polly looked
up and saw the witch standing before them, and
all her old fears returned.</p>

<p>"Well Polly," said the old woman, "are you
still afraid of me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a magic spell was wrought. Polly looked
in astonishment. The hag had changed from an
old withered thing to a very beautiful young
woman.</p>

<p>"You thought that I was ugly, little girl. Now
that you are feeling better and happier I appear to
you as wonderful as your own thoughts. People
always have the things they desire&mdash;that is, if they
truly desire them. We are what we make ourselves.
No matter how crippled or distorted we
may be, still we may be happy and beautiful if we
so desire. Happiness is within and is not to be
chased like a butterfly and bagged."</p>

<p>Now Polly was not so sure that she liked the
witch after all; in fact, she wished that she would
go away and leave them alone. In a moment
the woman changed to an ugly creature again. Polly
started to run away but the witch caught her
up in her arms and hugged her close, and when she
was through the witch again became the lovely
creature that she had been a few moments ago.</p>

<p>"Now you must not think wicked thoughts,"
said she; "if you do, I shall have to remain ugly.
If you only knew how it hurts to be ugly I believe
you would try to be good, if only for my sake."</p>

<p>"Please, mother," pleaded the child, "if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49-51]</a></span>
forgive me this time I shall always be good because
I want to, both for your sake and because I wish
to be good. I am very much ashamed of myself."</p>

</div>

<p>Polly threw her arms around the good mother
and hugged her. From that hour, they became
friends. And sitting down on the grass the good
woman explained the working of the tower.</p>

<p>"That spire," she said, "reaches to heaven and
has millions and millions of disks on its sides. These
instruments are the sound-receivers of the whole
world. Every sound is magnified and made sweeter
by the condensers. Every prayer, every song,
and every musical note is caught here and made
clearer and stronger. Every good deed done is
praised and every kind word reechoed."</p>

<p>"Did you say," inquired the girl, "that every
angry word or wicked prayer is retold on these
bells? That would be terrible!" Polly was thinking
of her own naughty thoughts.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," answered the woman, "everything
is heard here. But the strange thing about
the bells is that a wicked thing is a thousand times
reduced. These disks repeat everything good that
is said and throw it back to the poor old world to
brighten the speaker and the world itself. Good
thoughts, too, are reflected and sent to earth again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to gladden human beings. Wicked things are detected
and examined, but only good things are sent
to earth again."</p>

<p>Then the woman led the children a short distance
from the tower and asked them to listen.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" screamed Polly, "I heard a bad
word."</p>

<p>"Yes," explained the woman, "you heard that
word before it reached the bells; but if you were to
listen, it would be so changed that you would not
recognize it. But let us go and see other things
about the great steeple."</p>

<p>She led them to the base of the building and
showed them a queer-looking register that worked
like a modern adding machine. A ribbon continually
ran out of one end and was rolled on a big
spool.</p>

<p>"This," explained the guide, "records every
deed done by everybody in the world. It is connected
with the disks and never gets out of tune."</p>

<p>They examined the machine, and saw millions
and millions of spools slowly rolling as the minutes
passed. There was a spool for each individual that
ever lived on earth. At every one's death his spool
was laid away in the great tower above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful?" exclaimed Polly. "I
should like to see my spool, dear mother."</p>

<p>The woman took the girl to the back of the
machine and showed her her own life-spool. The
ribbon was very small, but the guide detached it
and gave it to the child to read. As she unwound
it, she read: "I wish that God would punish all the
wicked people I know!" Polly dropped the spool
and hid her face: these were her own words.</p>

<p>"Do not feel badly, dear Polly," whispered the
mother, "and do not look now for any more bad
records of yourself; but fill the rest of the spool
with good words and good deeds, and in the end
your record will be rewritten, made bright and
clear." She then picked the girl up and held her to
her breast, kissing her tenderly.</p>

<p>At this moment Polly heard the disks ring out:
"Polly!" and she cried, "Goodie! Goodie!"</p>

<p>It was her mother calling her for breakfast.
Polly sat up and rubbed her eyes. "Oh, mamma&mdash;where
is the mother witch? Where is Harry?"</p>

<p>Her mother looked puzzled at first, but she
quickly realized that her little daughter had been
dreaming. "I'll be the mother witch, my dear,"
she said, "and we will find Harry some day soon."</p>

<h2>MR. ROOSTER</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="75" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">In</span> a certain back yard lives a colony of
most interesting chickens. You could
not imagine that feathered things would
perform such capers as they do.</p>

<p>One fine morning, after Mrs. Black Hen had
spent a restless night on the roost, she addressed
Mrs. Brown Hen with these words:</p>

<p>"Do you know, Brownie, my husband snores,
and I did not sleep a wink last night!"</p>

<p>"Just to think of that! A snoring husband is a
dreadful thing," Brownie returned.</p>

<p>Brownie cackled all day from group to group
about the snoring husband. The gossip grew as
the day advanced till all the hens were cackling
and exchanging winks and the rooster, thinking
that the hens were laying an unusual number of
eggs, crowed with great zest. This amused the
hens very much, for, without knowing it, the rooster
was making fun of himself. He would have
been extremely angry had he known the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The poor hens cackled themselves into fits over
the thing. It was so funny!</p>

<p>The cook of the house to which the back yard
belonged at once thought that the poor creatures
had "the gapes." Now the gapes is nearly always
fatal, but sometimes death may be averted by an
application of red pepper. No wonder the cook
was mistaken, for by this time the hens were rolling,
kicking and cackling. The rooster was sitting
on the fence almost shouting his head off.</p>

<p>But when the cook ran out of the house and
dosed every hen with Cayenne pepper, the surprised
chickens sprang to their feet and rushed about
madly. All the fun was gone. Some of them
leaned against the coop and gasped for breath,
while others rushed for the watering trough.</p>

<p>During the performance, the rooster flew to the
highest place possible and screamed with delight,
for he had at last gotten through his thick head
that the joke had been on him, but was now on
his wives.</p>

<p>Oh, but the hens were mad! That evening they
crept to bed with tears in their little red eyes and
vengeance in their small hearts. It had been agreed
to watch the old fellow and see if it was true that
he was a snorer. Not a hen slept that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>All went as usual till about eleven o'clock,
when suddenly the rooster opened his mouth and
screamed, "Cock-a-doodle-doooo!"</p>

<p>This was not really snoring, as you easily see,
but a natural burst of pride, praise and warning
to keep the bogies away. Nevertheless, the hens
in their bad temper were no judges of any matter,
let alone snoring in the middle of the night. They
nudged each other very wisely. They had caught
him at last and there were twenty witnesses. One
o'clock came and he repeated the same words. The
hens were delighted, for they would have their innings
in the morning.</p>

<p>When morning came, the hens openly twitted
the rooster about his snoring. At first he paid little
attention to their taunts, but as the day wore on
he became very much exasperated. The hens kept
their own quarters and refused to have anything to
do with him, and he, manlike, was determined to
be near them. Whenever he came into their
"midst," as they chatted, they just left him there
twiddling his fine wings. He was much enraged
and gave chase to many of them. Sometimes he
almost caught one; but when that was about to
happen, the others pitched in and drove him off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57-59]</a></span>
very much crestfallen. The hens were wise enough
that day to stand together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/illus03.jpg" width="425" height="600" alt="Mr. Rooster" />
<div class="caption"><p>ELEANOR HOWARD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When all had retired as usual, the hens waited
for the rooster to enter their coop. But he did not
come. Some suggested that they should go in a
body and compel his majesty to come home. He
had never before remained out all night, as some
husbands do! They had a hard time sleeping that
night, for they greatly missed the rooster.</p>

<p>But the rooster sat all the while on the back
fence vowing vengeance.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the morning, when all
was still, one of the hens felt a sharp pain in her
breast. She wakened and scrambled to her feet,
but was instantly dragged to the floor by a weasel.
She screamed and struggled to escape. The other
hens joined in the clatter. It was with the greatest
difficulty that she escaped with her life.</p>

<p>The weasel fled when the noise became pronounced,
for he was afraid of a human. The poor
hen was terribly wounded. Not a wink of sleep
had the hens the remainder of that night, and they
were glad when the sun rose. They sought the
rooster and told the hard-hearted fellow the awful
story of the night raid, but he just opened his
mouth and crowed with pleasure. They were indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and walked off and left him to his laughs.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, when all was the quietest in
Chickenville, the rooster joined his wives and talked
very seriously about what had occurred.
"Now," said he in conclusion, "this trouble has
been brought about through gossip. You have
had your fun and I have had mine. The best thing
to do is to let bygones be bygones and all of us
turn over a new leaf."</p>

<p>The hens unwillingly consented, for the sun
was setting and they feared the night.</p>

<p>Since then Mr. Rooster has enjoyed great comfort,
and whenever the hens begin to gossip he
opens his red mouth and screeches "RED PEPPER!"</p>

<h2>THE MID-EARTH PEOPLE</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-u.jpg" width="73" height="75" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Uncle</span> Rupert, the children's friend,
had just returned from a wonderful trip
through the Orient and therefore had
many startling things to tell to his nephews
and nieces. He was such a famous story-teller
that when he described anything the children
actually thought they saw it happening.</p>

<p>On the sunny afternoon of Easter day, the children
begged their uncle to take them to a park and
tell them all about his trip. Uncle Rupert was quite
willing, and fifteen minutes later a dozen boys and
girls, accompanied by a big man, started on a street
car to the park.</p>

<p>"I am not going to tell you anything now about
my trip abroad," began Uncle Rupert when they
reached their destination, "for this is Eastertide
and I wish to talk about Easter!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried the whole crowd, "Please
don't! Tell us something more interesting! We
have had one sermon today, and it was&mdash;pretty
dry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Rupert smiled and, raising his head, began
again: "I will let you be the judges as to the
dullness of so-called 'moral' stories after we are
through. If you are not satisfied, then I shall jump
off this cliff!"</p>

<p>With this assurance, twelve eager bodies sat
in silence waiting for him to begin.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready?" asked Uncle Rupert.
"Then place your hands on your knees. Now, Tom,
do not crowd Madge. That is the right way; heads
up and eyes to the front. One, two, three and we
are off."</p>

<p>"Here he is! See the little man? He is just
coming out from a hole in the ground, opposite
you."</p>

<p>The children looked and, to their amazement,
saw a midget crawling from the earth. He was
dressed in tight-fitting breeches of blue with stockings
to match. Red shoes, with golden buckles,
were on his feet, and hanging over his shoulders
was a rich crimson cape, fastened about his throat
with a pearl clasp. At his belt dangled a highly
polished sword, and in his hand he carried a black
plumed hat. Not a sign of a beard was on his face,
and his hair hung in curls on his back. He looked
as though he had stepped out of an old fashion
plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The youngsters were too surprised to move or
speak; they hardly dared to breathe, for fear that
he would vanish. The stranger walked toward
Uncle Rupert and bowed to him.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, who are you?" demanded the big
uncle, "and what brings you here?"</p>

<p>"I am an exile just banished from my own
country," said the little man. "King Vitius and his
selfish wife drove me away because I have always
said that there is a better country above us."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Madge, "what stupid people
they must be not to know of this beautiful America."</p>

<p>The man sobered, and Uncle Rupert asked
him: "Where is this dull world, and what is your
name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Pietas, and our people live in the
center of the earth," replied the dwarf.</p>

<p>Uncle Rupert smiled as he watched the children
staring with wide-open mouths.</p>

<p>"We shall all go with you," began the wily
story-teller, looking out of the corner of his eye to
see how his scheme was taking, "and help you to
regain your place in your own land."</p>

<p>"I cannot go back, because they would kill me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and besides, if I told them what I have seen today,
they would laugh me to scorn."</p>

<p>"We shall go and force them to take you
back!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>"But I do not want to go back," answered the
little man. "This is a glorious country. Our sun
does not shine so brightly as yours. If my people
only knew the truth, they would never think of
their country as the greatest and best one. It is
a poor gloomy world."</p>

<p>"But!" pleaded Madge, "you can return with
us when we have fulfilled our mission of proving
what you told the king."</p>

<p>Pietas agreed, on these terms, and turning on
his heels, beckoned them to follow. All started
after him, and when they got to the hole that the
midget had come out of, he sprang lightly down
a small embankment and disappeared through the
opening into a cave below.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Tom, jumping in after him, "let
us hurry."</p>

<p>They all followed without hesitation. Uncle
Rupert was the last to go down.</p>

<p>When they had gone about a quarter of a mile
through the underground passage, it became so
dark that they lost their way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder where Pietas is?" shouted Uncle
Rupert. "The rascal has deserted us. Come, boys,
let us call his name."</p>

<p>The children screamed, "Pietas!" three or four
times, and then the little fellow appeared with a
lantern.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by deserting us, Pietas?"
asked Uncle Rupert.</p>

<p>"I was hoping you would not follow me," answered
the dwarf; "and I was wishing that you
would get tired and give up the venture. It may
mean death to us all."</p>

<p>Fear now showed itself in the company, and
some wanted to turn back, but others begged Uncle
Rupert to go on, and after much talk it was decided
to proceed. Tom was chosen leader, Pietas
and Uncle Rupert were the guides, and in double
column they began their journey.</p>

<p>Suddenly as they strode along at a brisk pace,
the earth slid from beneath them, and they fell
feet first, down, down&mdash;they did not know where.
Filled with terror, they could only think of what
might happen when they struck something.</p>

<p>At last, with a great jolt, they landed and went
sprawling in all directions. When they scrambled
to their feet they were glad to be alive, and for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
few moments they stood there panting and wondering.</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" exclaimed Uncle Rupert,
"that was a terrible fall! I wonder where we are
now? Tell us, Pietas."</p>

<p>Pietas said they had fallen three miles. But
the force of gravity being not so strong near the
center of the earth they did not fall as fast as they
would have fallen near the surface. They were
near his own kingdom, he said, and a walk of about
a hundred yards would bring them to the alligator's
tail.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid of the animal, my dear people,"
he said, "for he cannot harm you. We shall
find the monster lying in the path. We shall walk
on the beast for a number of yards, but he cannot
harm us nor shake us off. There will be a little
danger when we get to the head, but if we jump
from his nose without falling, no harm can come to
us. The name of the creature is Mortuus, and he
is dangerous only to those who try to leave our
kingdom. Few have escaped his deadly bite when
doing that. But let us move on at once."</p>

<p>The children did not hesitate to follow, for Uncle
Rupert gave them confidence. When they
came to the great tail, they stepped lightly upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and walked along, as they might have walked on
board an ocean liner.</p>

<p>"Hist!" exclaimed Pietas, "let us all gather
together and get ready to run and jump off the end
of his snout. This is the beginning of the Middle
Earth Kingdom."</p>

<p>Uncle Rupert took little Bee in his arms, and
the rest followed the dwarf, with Uncle Rupert in
the rear.</p>

<p>They walked with some difficulty upon the
great head of the alligator, for he kept opening and
shutting his jaws. When he opened his mouth,
they seemed to be going uphill, and when he shut
it, they felt as if they were sliding downhill. How
the boys did enjoy it! But the girls found the road
a little rough.</p>

<p>When they came to jump off, Uncle Rupert
showed them how to do so while the jaws were
shut; then the fall was only seven or eight feet,
whereas, with the mouth open, it would have been
at least a hundred feet.</p>

<p>As soon as they had all landed safely, the monster
began to roar like fifty bulls. He must have
been disappointed at losing his supper.</p>

<p>But the children turned their backs on Mortuus
and ran about a level held, gathering black roses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and gazing upon the strange scenery that lay before
them.</p>

<p>They had never seen such peculiar flowers. All
natural things were of a somber hue because there
was so little sunlight. But the girls were pleased
with the new sights and the boys took off their
shoes and waded in the brooks, chasing little fish.</p>

<p>To Uncle Rupert it was no wonder that the
people would not believe what Pietas said about
the better land, seeing that they had to face the
monster alligator in their journey to the United
States.</p>

<p>"Pietas," said Uncle Rupert, "I do not believe
we shall be able to convince your people, for the
only entrance to the upper country is so horrible.
If we could only kill or disable the monster, we
might succeed in bringing your people out of this
place."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the dwarf, "and besides no one
has ever come back to tell about the other country.
I am the first to return from there, and I hope,
through your help, to be able to make my people
believe my report. As for the monster, I am no
longer afraid of him. If you and the boys will
help me, perhaps we can put out his eyes so that
he will not be able to harm people that come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
him on their journey upward. Then, too, they
can easily step onto his nose when he shuts his
mouth, and when he opens it again he will lift them
so that they can walk along his huge carcass and go
on their way."</p>

<p>In a hurried conference, the boys worked out a
plan. While the girls were left playing in the
meadow, the boys, led by Uncle Rupert, cautiously
approached the brute.</p>

<p>They found it hard to keep from being sucked
into the gaping mouth, but by holding fast to one
another they avoided that danger, while Uncle
Rupert lifted Pietas, armed with his little sword,
and threw the tiny fellow onto the snout. As the
beast opened his mouth, thinking that his dinner
had come, Pietas slid down his back out of danger.</p>

<p>The children kept at a safe distance and
watched the little man as he crept toward the creature's
left eye. When near enough, with his
sword he made a quick thrust which put that eye
quite out. The alligator roared in pain, and threw
open his jaws with such force as to pitch Pietas
into the air, whence he fell at the feet of the astonished
party of boys. The fellow was badly hurt,
and they had to carry him to a nearby brook, where
they bathed his bruises. He soon recovered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
became light-hearted again, although he was sorry
that he had not put out both of the alligator's eyes.</p>

<p>"But," said Uncle Rupert, "if we approach him
on his blind side, we may still be able to escape
the danger."</p>

<p>The roaring of the monster brought the girls to
the place, and when they found that the party were
all safe, they asked Pietas to take them to see his
people. Uncle Rupert and the boys joined in the
request, and so Pietas led the way and they all followed.</p>

<p>They came to a good road that led through a
beautiful country. This highway crossed a very
large river. Uncle Rupert explained to the children
that this was the source of one of the greatest
rivers of America. They passed over the bridge
and approached a little village. As they walked
through the streets of the town the little pygmies,
not bigger than babies, cried after them: "There
go the giants!"</p>

<p>Their destination was the Royal City, which
they could see as soon as they got out of the village.
It was a beautiful sight. There nestled the city
in the peculiar dull atmosphere, its spires and tall
buildings shining with pure gold.</p>

<p>Before they reached the city, they were seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
by some of the king's men. They had thought
that the country was well rid of the hated Pietas.
Great were their surprise and disgust when they
saw him back and in company with giants. He
had told them that he would return some day and
prove to them the truth of all he had said. Here
he was, and what were they to do?</p>

<p>The king hastily called his wise men together,
and had a few words with them. They determined
to capture Pietas if possible, and to destroy the
giants. The army was called out and prepared to
meet the enemy and disturber at the gate. The
children were indeed surprised, when they arrived
at the entrance, to be met by an army of pigmies,
although they did not look dangerous for they
were so small. The party supposed that the army
had been sent out to greet them and Uncle Rupert
had prepared in his mind a long speech of thanks.
But things were different from what they imagined.</p>

<p>A guard, consisting of a captain and a few subordinates,
approached them, and the captain,
walking up to Pietas said: "In the name of his
Majesty we arrest you as a disturber of the public
conscience."</p>

<p>"But," said Uncle Rupert, "this man has done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
nothing to deserve arrest. We brought him hither
so that we might confirm the things that he has
told you. He is no disturber of the public conscience."</p>

<p>But without paying any attention, the soldiers
began to march off with their prisoner. The children
knew that this meant death to poor Pietas.</p>

<p>Uncle Rupert looked at his companions to see
what they wanted to do about it. He had not long
to wait, for Tom, who was as big as four of the
soldiers, snatched Pietas from the guard and
shoved the captain over. Thereupon the guard
fled, and the captain, scrambling to his feet, ran
after his men.</p>

<p>"I'll beat the whole bunch myself!" boasted
Tom as he rolled up his sleeves.</p>

<p>Pietas begged the Americans to return and
leave him to his fate, but they would not. Then
the pygmy army prepared to charge the little band
and take him if they could.</p>

<p>"Please," said Pietas, "let me meet my people
in my own way. I feel that I am to blame for
bringing you here."</p>

<p>"No, you are not!" cried all the children with
one breath. "Indeed not," added Uncle Rupert.</p>

<p>Pietas smiled and then turned and fled to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
armed men. In vain did Tom and others call him
back. The party watched as he quietly gave himself
up to the law of his people. The soldiers
wheeled and marched with their captive to the
palace of the king. A mob quickly gathered
around the Americans and began to threaten them.</p>

<p>"Beware, good people!" shouted Uncle Rupert.
"Take care that you do not hurt a single
hair of one of these children! We are not come to
harm you, but to tell you a great truth. There is
a fine country just above your heads where the sun
shines all day and the stars come out in the evening;
a land full of trees and birds and flowers and
brooks. The air is not stuffy as it is here, nor is
the place gloomy like this. All men and women
are giants in our land. Now you have captured
Pietas!" continued Uncle Rupert, coming to the
business in hand. "I tell you that, if you do not let
him go, we will fight this day for his freedom; and
if we lose, be it known that our people will quickly
send men to destroy your whole nation!"</p>

<p>To the surprise of the American party, Uncle
Rupert's remarks were greeted with cheers of approval.
The multitude of little folks gathered
about the strangers and shook their hands. At
last they believed the story of the other world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Many wished to go to America with the returning
travelers.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Rupert led the whole crowd to the
palace of the king, hoping to rescue poor Pietas.
When they got there, the king was throned on a
high platform, while Pietas, in chains, stood before
him, the king's soldiers standing at rest and looking
on.</p>

<p>Uncle Rupert made his way through the crowd
of people and reached the platform.</p>

<p>There he turned to the soldiers and leaders and
appealed to them for the life of his little friend.</p>

<p>The king arose with fear and asked: "Who art
thou, great giant?"</p>

<p>"I am Rupert Randall, a citizen of the United
States of America!"</p>

<p>"Do you speak of the Upper Country, sir, as
this impudent Pietas has done?"</p>

<p>"I do, O King, and I wish that I could persuade
you of the truth. Pietas is an honorable man and
has tried to help your people, but you would not
let him!"</p>

<p>The king wrung his hands and exclaimed: "I
am determined to free Pietas now. I am puzzled
beyond words, and fear I may be undone; but I
shall set Pietas free."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>But the soldiers shouted: "Away with the imposter!
He has declared against the army. He is
no friend of the king. Besides, these Americans
have insulted and abused our captain!"</p>

<p>The king tried to appease the multitude but
they kept on crying for the life of Pietas. No one
could speak, no one could hear, because of the
screaming. At last the poor king motioned to the
people to leave, and the soldiers took Pietas and
marched him away.</p>

<p>The Americans followed at a little distance,
watching for an opportunity to rescue their friend,
but before they could interfere, the soldiers had
bound Pietas to a tree.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom and Madge rushed through the
crowd and struck right and left, knocking soldiers
and citizens down in their mad rush to pull their
friend from the tree. Uncle Rupert, with the rest
of the children, followed the brave little leaders.</p>

<p>In a few moments the rescuers had Pietas unbound
and in their arms.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was all but unconscious from
fright and rough usage. The soldiers fled before
the giants as they carried their dear little friend
away. Pietas revived, sat up, called all the people
to his side, and told them he was glad that they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
treated him so. "For," explained he, "they have
not really hurt me, and I rejoice to suffer in witnessing
to the truth."</p>

<p>No sooner had he spoken than many poor people
came to him and begged to be allowed to go
with him. He told them to remain and tell all the
others the good news. "When you are through
doing your duty, then I will come for you. Meanwhile,
I am going with my friends to the Upper
Country."</p>

<p>With sorrow he bade them good-by, and with
the American party he turned and walked the road
to the great alligator. At first, the children were
afraid of the monster, but soon they cautiously approached
him on his blind side, without attracting
his attention. It was not difficult for them to
spring upon his head; but when they had done so,
the monster opened his mouth and threw them into
the air and they rolled down his nose.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" they shouted. It took them a few
minutes to realize that they had been in the park
all the time and that Uncle Rupert had been telling
them a story. "Oh, Uncle, where is Pietas?"
asked Madge. "Pietas," replied Uncle Rupert, "is
not here, he has returned to his own country to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
his people more about his new home. He expects
to lead all his people here some day.</p>

<p>"I have preached you a long sermon, my dears,
and I do hope that you understood it. Pietas represented
the Master who was killed but was revived
by his Father to return again on Easter to tell his
own country of the beautiful heaven and how to
live so as to be worthy of it."</p>

<p>"Do tell us another story!" cried Madge. "We
did so enjoy that one. Why, I thought that I was
in the land of the Under World and I pitied the
poor creatures there."</p>

<p>"So, my dear, do the saints pity us in this
world; and they are hoping that we will be good, so
that we may reach the Upper World.</p>

<p>"Now what do you say&mdash;shall I jump off the
cliff?"</p>

<p>"No!" they all shouted.</p>

<h2>THE BLACK HUS</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="72" height="75" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">To</span> tell the complete story of the Black
Hus would take as many years as civilized
man has been on earth. The largest
state in the Union is scarcely big enough
to contain the books that could be written about
the terrible monster.</p>

<p>Even today there is a Hus in every country,
but this particular Hus lived in Greece many hundred
years ago. It was related to the Hebrew
Chazir spoken of in the Bible.</p>

<p>You remember the Chazir that attacked Noah
when he was making merry in his tent. Noah was
drinking some good wine, when all at once the
beast rushed upon him, tore his clothing and seized
him by the throat. When his sons came to his
rescue, they found their father lying naked in his
tent, in a helpless condition, and the dreadful Chazir
standing over him. As soon as the beast saw
the stalwart sons, he fled into the night.</p>

<p>You remember that it was Ham who laughed
at his father's condition, because he had not seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the Chazir, but only his father's foolish condition.
Ham's two brothers, Shem and Japheth, covered
their father with a sheepskin blanket and went
their way much wiser.</p>

<p>Passing now to Greece, we read of a nobleman
there who had many sons and daughters. The
eldest son, who was the apple of his eye, he called
Egkartes because he was a good, honest fellow.</p>

<p>"Egkartes," the father said one day, "I am going
to give you the next litter of pigs born on the
farm."</p>

<p>This was a fine offer, for it meant the beginning
of the boy's fortune.</p>

<p>Not long after this there was a family of thirteen
little pigs on the farm. Twelve of the baby
pigs were perfectly white, but one little fellow's
skin was black as pitch, and his eyes were red as
live coals. Almost as soon as he was born he began
to show a savage disposition.</p>

<p>The black fellow soon awakened the curiosity
of the neighborhood. No pig like him
anywhere to be seen. He grew twice as fast as
his little brothers, and daily became more savage.
When eighteen months old, he weighed fifteen
hundred pounds, and had to be kept in a separate
pen and watched day and night for fear he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
devour his brothers. People came from far and
near to see the monster, and went away thanking
their stars that he was not allowed to run at large.</p>

<p>One beautiful autumn day the nobleman gave
a thanksgiving dinner for his freemen. The best
of foods and drinks were served, and the men ate
till they could eat no more, and drank till they
could scarcely see. They became very noisy and
filled the banqueting hall with such profane language
that the Greek maids who had been engaged
to dance for their amusement fled in fear.</p>

<p>No sooner had they gone than the black pig appeared
in the hall. Some of the men rose to drive
him back to his pen, but he would not go. He
stood before their blurred eyes, shaking his ugly
head and gnashing his terrible teeth.</p>

<p>Some of the stupid fellows thought that the
pig must be mad; others said he must be a devil
clothed in pig's flesh. They all kept a safe distance
from him, hiding wherever they could, till at
last Egkartes cautiously approached the monster,
intending to lead him to his pen, as the youth had
done on like occasions. But when as usual, he
took the pig by the ear, the beast turned upon him
with a thundering roar, seized his arm, and shook
him as a terrier shakes a rat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the half-drunken father, staggering to
his son's help, beat the animal over the head with
a great stick; but this only increased the pig's fury,
and dropping the boy, he ran amuck against the
company, biting every man in the room.</p>

<p>One man, trying to escape by jumping over the
pig, landed at full length on the creature's back,
where he clung for dear life. The black pig did
his best to shake the man off, but he held on with
might and main. Round and round spun the pig
squealing and grunting furiously. The man kept
his hold so firmly, that at length some of his companions
crept from their hiding places and cheered
the plucky rider.</p>

<p>Finally the pig sprang through the door and ran
for the open country, the man clinging to him like
a "broncho-buster," while his companions&mdash;as
many as were not too stupified by excess at table&mdash;gave
chase, frantically shouting. Down the lane
the strange steed charged, over the fence he leaped,
madly shaking himself at every jump, and continued
his career till he came to a narrow footbridge
over a deep river, and tried to cross it. As
he reached the middle of the bridge, he slipped and
rolled into the stream below, carrying his rider
with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>When he reappeared the man was swimming
desperately for the bank, which he soon succeeded
in reaching. The pig also landed safely and disappeared
into the opposite woods.</p>

<p>"Well, boys!" exclaimed the pig rider, sobered,
"that was a narrow escape! That little
bridge saved my life. That was one time when I
needed some one to help me let go!"</p>

<p>These men were a sorry-looking crew as they
returned home tattered and torn. There was not
a man among them with a whole garment.</p>

<p>The Hus never came back to the farm.</p>

<p>When the story of his antics was repeated from
mouth to mouth, people would not believe it. But
the monster was by no means through. A month
later he appeared in the Royal City and killed
many of its inhabitants. The rumor spread everywhere
that the Hus was devouring the men of
Greece.</p>

<p>The king was much alarmed and offered a reward
for its capture, but the dreadful destruction
went on. Finally his Majesty offered the hand of
his only daughter and the half of his kingdom to
the man who would slay the brute. But in spite
of all endeavors to win so great a prize, the pig
continued his terrible work, appearing now here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
now there, and killing even the bravest men of the
kingdom. Strange to say the monster seldom attacked
women.</p>

<p>A year passed, and the Hus had grown to a
more enormous size. Some said that he was as
big as an elephant.</p>

<p>For a long time the nobleman and his family
had to remain in hiding because of the fury of the
multitude, who blamed him for raising the pig.
The king seized his property, and the nobleman
became a poor man and for some years he and his
family were outcasts.</p>

<p>At last Egkartes determined to redeem his
father's good name and, if possible, win the fair
princess.</p>

<p>His father and mother were pleased with his
boldness and readily consented to his undertaking.
At once great preparations were made, and five
men were persuaded to accompany the young
adventurer. With brave hearts they set forth,
confident of victory.</p>

<p>On the third day, as they approached the city
they met a woman crying as if her heart must
break. She told them that on the night before,
her husband had been killed by some monster. She
described the spot, near her dwelling, where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
had found her husband, Methuson, dying on the
roadside. "I ran to him," she said, "and held his
head in my arms. His clothes were torn almost off
his back. When I spoke to him, he opened his
eyes and muttered something about a black beast,
and then fell back senseless."</p>

<p>The men accompanied the poor weeping
woman to her miserable hut, and as they stepped
within and beheld Methuson and sniffed the odor
of the place, they knew that the Hus was the beast
that had done the deed.</p>

<p>Egkartes stooped and listened over the unconscious
man's heart for some sign of life. In a few
moments he rose to his feet, and turning to the
wife, exclaimed: "Your husband is not dead!"</p>

<p>Sure enough the unfortunate fellow sat up. His
eyes were red and inflamed, his temper was likewise
fiery, for he broke into loud curses. But in
a little while he recovered his reason and thanked
his deliverers. Methuson begged to be allowed
to accompany the band of Hus-hunters, and they
readily gave their consent.</p>

<p>Toward evening of the next day, as they neared
the City, they heard more news of the monster,
who had been doing terrible damage to the people
of the suburbs. Late that evening seven weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
men crawled into beds in a very humble lodging-house.</p>

<p>As Egkartes felt himself slipping into a comfortable
sleep, he was startled by the cry of a
woman. He ran out to the house across the street,
whence came the cry, and entered without knocking.</p>

<p>He found a mother holding her baby high up,
while the awful Hus kept snapping at the child. A
dozen men were in the room, sleeping off a debauch.
Egkartes sprang at the monster, who
seemed to recognize him, but without showing any
fear, turned and coolly walked out of the house. It
wounded the pride of the young champion to see
the enemy treat him so indifferently. He returned
to his men feeling disheartened. He could see no
way of killing the monster. What could he do?</p>

<p>After many weeks of failure, Egkartes wandered
to the king's garden and sat down near the
entrance, where he found many other Greek
youths who, like himself, aspired to the hand of
the princess. They all knew that it was her daily
custom to walk in the garden at sunset, and they
were waiting to see her.</p>

<p>When the princess appeared, the young men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
stood up and humbly saluted her&mdash;all but Egkartes,
who remained sitting.</p>

<p>She approached the gate, and looking earnestly
into all the faces of the young men, paused
for a moment, and threw down a rose. Then there
was a wild scramble among the rival youths for
possession of the flower, only a poor remnant
of which finally remained in the hands of the
strongest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the princess was wondering about
the handsome boy who took no part in the struggle,
and presently she summoned Egkartes to her
side. The youth rose, scarcely believing his senses,
and bowing very low, approached the object
of his despairing affection.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?" the princess asked, "and
why have you not taken part in the contest for the
flower?"</p>

<p>"I am your most humble servant, Egkartes,
and I beg your pardon if I have displeased you by
not joining in that mad rush for the flower. I
must save my strength for a more serious contest."</p>

<p>"But," replied the princess, "I judge by your
conduct that you are unwilling to please me."</p>

<p>For a moment the boy trembled on the brink
of confessing his love, but just as the words were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
forming on his lips, the princess motioned him
away. The boy was broken-hearted, for he was
too blind to see that the princess had really singled
him out because he had not entered into the contest,
and had shown himself different from the
common run of love-sick youths.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Egkartes turned away when the
Hus came running toward the princess. She was
almost paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p>But who could describe the panic that seized
the foolish mob of young men who had fought so
valiantly for the rose? At sight of the Hus, they
fled in all directions. Egkartes alone remained
to defend the princess. When he saw his foe, he
shouted with joy and rushed at the monster with
drawn sword.</p>

<p>The beast recognized his adversary, and, opening
his great jaws, charged upon him. When the
combatants met, the boy's sword entered the pig's
mouth. As he withdrew his weapon, Egkartes
fell, and the pig, leaping over him, disappeared.
Regaining his feet, the youth gave pursuit, brandishing
his bloody sword.</p>

<p>The princess saw the whole encounter, and as
she ran to the palace, her thoughts were divided
between the peril from which she had escaped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the wonderful valor of her young preserver. She
was afraid to tell her father of what had happened,
lest he should deprive her of her free hour, but all
that night she lay awake dreaming of her hero and
praying that she might meet him again.</p>

<p>Three days later the city rejoiced over the news
that a conjuror had destroyed the Hus. The fellow
was brought to the king to explain about it.
He said he had destroyed the monster by means
of a charm. When asked to produce the head of
the pig, he said that as soon as the creature died
he vanished into smoke. The man's story was so
plausible that the king believed him, and ordered
a great feast in his honor.</p>

<p>Poor Egkartes heard the news with sorrow,
and the princess, shutting herself up in her inner
room, mourned bitterly. She did not wish to marry
the conjuror, for now she loved the brave Egkartes.</p>

<p>On the day of the feast the whole city was gay
and the people ate and drank in excess. Even Egkartes's
men joined in the merrymaking; but the
young hero himself sulked in a dismal cellar.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for the boy that he had not
joined with the masses in their dissipation, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Hus, knowing that they could not resist, came into
the city and bit thousands of the people.</p>

<p>When he heard the cry of the Hus in the streets,
Egkartes emerged from the cellar, eager for
another combat.</p>

<p>People were scurrying for safety. None but
the boy was armed. Hither and thither ran the
black brute biting as many as he could.</p>

<p>As Egkartes rushed at the beast, that knowing
warrior recognized the young Greek again and
charged him furiously, first springing at his throat.</p>

<p>The boy stood his ground, and thrusting his
sword, as in their previous fight, into the Hus's
mouth, drove so hard that the weapon sank deep
into the stomach of the brute.</p>

<p>The Hus fell headlong, roaring loudly. Struggling
to his feet, he stood for a few moments, swaying
from side to side, while the blood flowed freely
from his mouth. The boy, without knowing it, had
struck the pig's only vulnerable spot, the mouth.
After a moment the great Hus turned and fled,
roaring like thunder. Though no one saw him
die, it seemed evident that he was mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Of course Egkartes became the hero of the
hour. He was carried by six strong men to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
palace of the king, who was feasting in his hall,
not knowing of the brave deed that the boy had
done. So when he heard the people shouting at
his gate, the king came to the palace steps
and called to the multitude who had followed
Egkartes:</p>

<p>"Why have you come here with all this noise?"
demanded his Majesty. "Have I not given you a
holiday and the freedom of the city? Why cannot
you caper in your own streets and lanes? Have I
no rights as king? Go to your homes or I shall call
my soldiers to drive you there. Begone, I say,
begone!"</p>

<p>"May it please your Majesty," said one of the
people, "we have brought the hero who has just
slain the Black Hus!"</p>

<p>"But," protested the angry king, "have I not
at this very moment the Black Hus hero at my
table feasting with my nobles? By magic he slew
the monster but yesterday!"</p>

<p>But the people shouted, "Away with the
magicman&mdash;away with the imposter!"</p>

<p>The king was much perplexed, but wishing to
learn the truth, he commanded silence while he listened
to the story of Egkartes and his victorious
encounter with the Hus. When he learned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
truth then the king ordered the lying conjuror to
be hanged, and immediately the poor imposter,
protesting and struggling in vain, was dragged
from the dining hall and hanged in the garden.</p>

<p>Two weeks after this Egkartes was taken to
the palace, with a great flourish of trumpets, and
was proclaimed the hero of the country. He knew
that he had not killed the pig as they had told the
king; but neither king nor people paid any attention
to his explanations. All insisted that he had
killed the monster and had a right to the great
reward.</p>

<p>The princess of course was delighted, and said
to Egkartes: "I do not care whether you have
killed the monster or not. I shall have you and
we shall live very happily together."</p>

<p>The boy yielded to her persuasion, and a week
later they sat together at a royal banquet in honor
of their coming marriage. The company was jubilant
with praise and merrymaking. The king, the
queen, the royal ladies and brave knights drank
deep and long of the red wine of the hills.</p>

<p>The hero was happiest of all until he began to
see knight after knight flushed and boisterous
from much eating and drinking. Then his
thoughts flitted back to the dinner at his father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
home, and to the first appearance of the Hus. He
could not shake off the feeling that the Hus would
appear again, for the beast always appeared when
men began to grow foolish through drink.</p>

<p>It was not long before the king noticed that the
boy was not laughing and drinking with the rest.</p>

<p>"Art thou sick, Egkartes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am not sick, most noble Sire," replied the
youth. "Be it known, O, King, that I have refrained
from drinking tonight because I want to
be ready for the Hus, which is sure to come wherever
there is such overindulgence."</p>

<p>Before he could proceed further, the knights
broke into furious curses. "Away with the imposter!
Away with him! Ha! Ha!"</p>

<p>The king commanded silence as he stood up
dizzy with wine. Red-faced and boiling with
anger he looked at the youth and said:</p>

<p>"Fetch in the guards and take this fellow to
the guard house, and presently we will have a
hanging in the reception hall! Bah! Thou too
hast thought to seize my daughter's hand by trickery!
Well, thou shalt hang!"</p>

<p>The king sat down and the guards seized the
boy by the back of the neck and dragged him
away, amid the laughter and jeers of the company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The boisterous merriment continued until the
princess stood up and motioned for silence. Then
she said:</p>

<p>"Most noble father, I now speak in behalf of
all the women of Greece. The men of Greece
have for years treated women as slaves, creatures
of their wills. You, my father, without my consent
offered my hand to any who should prove victor
over the Hus. You have already seen what has
happened. An imposter came first and frightened
me nearly to death! You did not care so long
as you could keep your foolish word. Now comes
a youth who thrice has repelled the Hus, and because
he has the courage to tell you the truth, you
order him hanged without mercy or any thought
of me. Henceforth I shall do my own choosing
when it comes to mating! If you hang Egkartes
then you will find my dead body in the morning by
the side of his! Why have you condemned him in
whom is our only hope of safety? If the Hus
should come tonight&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"What do you say, Miss Impudence? I'll see
whether your prophecy will come true. Let every
gate be barred! Fasten every door with a double
lock! Let the royal guards stand in every hallway!
And you, ungrateful maiden, dance before this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
company. By the gods! We'll see whether the
Hus is greater than the king!"</p>

<p>The king sat down heavily, and the princess
obediently arose to dance before a drunken assembly.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she stood upon the floor than in
rushed the Hus. Neither walls, nor doors nor
swords had been able to keep him out.</p>

<p>The queen was first to try to leave the room,
but the Hus flung himself upon her and buried his
teeth in her shoulder. The king attempted to
draw his sword, but the beast sprang upon him
before he could even touch the hilt, seized him
round the middle and shook him till he seemed like
to fall apart. The once brave knights lay where
they were and called loudly for the guards.</p>

<p>Amid the confusion the princess ran to the
guard room where her lover lay bound. When the
terrified guards heard that the Hus was in the
palace, they were only too glad to release their
prisoner.</p>

<p>Egkartes was not surprised to hear of the return
of the Hus. He gladly dashed to the banqueting
hall. When he appeared before him the Hus
dropped his latest victim and squealed with rage.
Well did the beast remember his many wounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
received at the hands of Egkartes. As if to take
revenge, he bounded toward the boy, who aiming
his sword again at the beast's mouth, drove the
weapon home, running it well down the throat.
With a roar of rage the Hus sprang back, dashed
for the nearest window, jumped to the earth, and
disappeared into the dark night, still roaring furiously.</p>

<p>In a moment the knights were on their feet.
Now that there was no danger they were eager to
defend the king and queen; but his Majesty,
ordering the knights out of the palace, embraced
the hero, exclaiming: "Thou shalt indeed be my
son."</p>

<p>So the royal marriage was consummated and
the princess became the wife of the noble Egkartes.</p>

<p>The first act of the prince was to banish all
drink from the kingdom, for, as he told the people,
the Hus could never be killed but would be helpless
as long as they refused to befuddle their senses
with wine. He received great honor and later
ascended to the throne&mdash;and the kingdom prospered
as long as it took heed to the words of
Egkartes.</p>

<h2>THE LEVIATHAN</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="74" height="75" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago, before New York was
settled, a poor old crocodile left her native
Egyptian shores and swam to the
mouth of the Hudson River. Up the
river bank she crawled, till she found a home.
Here she laid ten eggs and hid them in the hot
sand.</p>

<p>Soon ten wee long-jaws came out and crept
about in the sun. Mother crocodile fed her offspring
with small birds, that she caught by lying
in the river with her mouth wide open. The birds,
seeing only the upper part of the great jaws, were
easily fooled into mistaking them for an old tree
trunk. Sometimes as many as fifty of them flew
down to rest and gossip on the crocodile's teeth
and cold tongue. Suddenly, when the clatter was
loudest, the huge jaws came together with a
mighty snap, crushing every little warbler. Then
the cunning old mother fed her children with sweet
titbits.</p>

<p>In the course of five years one of the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
brood had grown to a monstrous size, and his ugly
temper made him the terror of all the others. One
day, in a fit of anger, he bit his two sisters so
badly that they died. Then the savage reptile
disappeared and stayed away, none of the family
knew where, for fifteen years.</p>

<p>At the end of that time, he returned to find
his mother dying, with her seven good sons about
her, weeping bitter tears. But not a sign of pity
did the returned wanderer show for his dying
mother and her sorrowing children.</p>

<p>He was now a monster more than a hundred
feet in length, and it was no wonder that when
the brothers&mdash;pygmies in comparison with him&mdash;saw
him coming toward them they fled in terror
to the river, leaving their helpless mother at the
mercy of her wicked son. Toward evening the
brothers crept to the bank to see what was going
on and the furious giant, who was lying in wait
for them caught five of the little fellows and killed
them as if in mere love of slaughter. The two
others saved their lives by hiding till dark, when
they fled to a place of safety down the river.</p>

<p>Not content with killing his brothers, the
fiendish destroyer turned upon his mother, telling
her that he had come back to avenge the insults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
heaped upon him when he was a little fellow; then
with a vicious snap he bit off her tail, and she died
at sundown.</p>

<p>"What a terrible brother!" thought the two
escaping crocodiles as they made their way farther
from the scene of danger. But the truth of the
whole matter was that the monstrous fellow was
not really their brother at all! He was the great
Leviathan from Asia. You see, after the old
crocodile had laid her ten eggs in the hot sun to
hatch, Mendacia, the mother of lies and injustice,
exchanged a Leviathan egg for one of the crocodile
eggs. So when the eggs were hatched, Mrs. Crocodile,
without knowing it, had a stranger among
her own children.</p>

<p>Mendacia was jealous of the new nation across
the waters, and had secretly followed the old
crocodile, hoping to destroy the young republic
through her terrible Leviathan. This monster was
related to all the Leviathans that did so much damage
to the children of Israel in the days of Moses.
These beasts had always been murderers and man-eaters
and Mendacia was the evil spirit that
prompted all the wicked deeds.</p>

<p>So here she was in the land of America with
her cruel monster fully grown and ready to begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
work. Fifteen years ago, when her pet had committed
murder, she it was who carried him away
to shield him from just punishment. She was with
him when he killed his mother, and Mendacia and
her slave Brutus applauded him for that crime of
unspeakable shame. After committing this terrible
deed, Leviathan lay down and slept for a
month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Brutus built a beautiful house on
Leviathan's back, and Mendacia richly furnished
it. When the sleeper awoke, slowly he opened
his dull eyes and blinked. Then, more slowly, he
opened his forty-foot mouth and shook his forty-foot
tail. As yet he was unconscious of the house
upon his back but when he rose to his short legs
and shook himself, he realized that he was holding
up something besides his own weight.</p>

<p>Finding that he could not shake off his strange
burden, the beast made for the river and attempted
to sink, but could not do that, for the house kept
him afloat. He tried to roll over, to turn a somersault,
but all in vain. At last, exhausted, he lay
in the river as if dead.</p>

<p>It was then that Mendacia spake words of reproof
to her beast. "Leviathan! You poor foolish
fellow! Why do you make such a fuss over a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that you cannot change? If you disturb my house
any more I'll be compelled to drive a nail through
your back into your heart. But if you obey me,
all will be well and I'll be your best friend. I'll
help you obtain your food, and I promise that one
human being a day will be furnished for your
evening meal. Come, will you agree to do as I say,
or not?"</p>

<p>The Leviathan thought for a long time and
ended in blinking his lazy consent.</p>

<p>Now, on the bank of the river lived a boy and
a girl. The boy's name was Lex and the girl's was
Veritas. Both were seventeen years old.</p>

<p>One hot July day Lex took his friend for a little
row up the Hudson. They had not gone far before
they spied a peculiar craft coming toward them.
Lex ceased rowing and the two gazed with wonder
at the strange sight. On came the wonderful
house, like a floating palace upon a brown island.</p>

<p>It was the Leviathan, of course. As it approached
them, a beautiful woman gracefully
walked toward the snout of the Leviathan, followed
by her slave, and both sat down on the
humps that formed the monster's eyebrows. From
these commanding positions they held curtains
over the creature's eyes, lest he should become too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
restive, and frighten away his prey. The beast
had not eaten a human morsel for many days and
he was very hungry. Nearer and nearer came
the boy and the girl to the threatened destruction.
But Mendacia, whose eyes were fastened upon the
boy, suddenly thought of a new way to vary her
life of plotting and murder. How amusing it
would be to drag the children aboard and play
with them a little before taking their lives! It
would be such fun to hear them crying and begging
for the mercy that would never be granted. So
she guided the Leviathan by gently tapping him
with her heel till the children's boat touched his
side, and then, quicker than can be told, she and
Brutus dragged the surprised youngsters aboard.</p>

<p>When the monster knew what the woman was
doing, and found that his anticipated dinner had
been lifted upon his back, his barking sounded like
thunder-claps and his great thrashing tail lashed
the water into foam. But the woman told her
captives that they were on an island and that the
noises were made by machinery.</p>

<p>She ordered a sumptuous luncheon and while
the children ate with great delight, she watched
them. Finally she determined to serve Veritas to
the hungry monster and keep Lex. Why not keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
him and make a slave of him? With this in view
she gave the boy a powerful drink which made
him entirely subject to her will while he was under
its influence. He entirely forgot poor Veritas.</p>

<p>When Veritas saw what influence the woman
had gained over Lex she was much disturbed.</p>

<p>As soon as she found an opportunity to speak
to her friend, the girl said: "Oh, Lex, do not go
near that woman, who is as ugly as she can be!"</p>

<p>Yes, she was ugly to all who did not like her,
but to Lex she seemed very beautiful, and he was
angry with Veritas for making such a remark. But
before he could reply they heard Mendacia talking
to her beast. "Be quiet for a little while," she said,
"your supper will soon be served." What did it all
mean? The crashing of the great jaws and the
roaring of the ravenous beast made a hideous din.</p>

<p>The children now knew that they were on the
back of some sea monster, and the thought made
both shudder; even Lex began to see the woman
as she was, though the charm had not entirely lost
its effect.</p>

<p>But he had not long to wait before learning her
real character. As soon as she had convinced the
monster that he would be fed, he quieted down,
and Mendacia walked with dignity toward the
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Before she reached them, her slave appeared
and delivered a message to his mistress.</p>

<p>"Most gracious queen," he said, bowing very
low, "there is a man swimming at a little distance.
What shall we do?"</p>

<p>Mendacia hesitated; but reflecting that the
magic potion she had given Lex would make everything
she did look right to him, she decided to secure
the bather for the Leviathan's meal. She did
not care for Veritas's opinion&mdash;in fact she was glad
of an opportunity to frighten her.</p>

<p>So she directed the beast toward the bather.
Being naked, the man modestly crouched as far
beneath the water as possible, and in amazement
he watched the craft gliding nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>When they were almost upon the poor fellow,
Veritas screamed. The man turned to flee, but
hesitated because he had no clothes, and only
sank deeper in the dark waters, while Mendacia
called to him with a gentle voice and an inviting
motion of her arm.</p>

<p>It did not take long for something to happen.
The hungry monster was overeager and snatched
for his prey too soon. With a wild yell, the man
sprang to his feet and plunged for the bank, the
Leviathan following him rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The children, speechless with fright, watched
the frantic efforts of the man striving to escape his
pursuer. With a sigh of relief they saw him, not
more than a few feet beyond the beast's snout,
reach the bank and stagger for safety. The monster
climbed the bank after him with his burden
swaying on his back like a captive balloon. But
the man reached a small cave, into which he flung
himself with all the strength that he had left.</p>

<p>All this happened so quickly that the children
did not comprehend it; they leaned weakly against
the side of the house, scarcely realizing that they
were on the beast's back.</p>

<p>By this time Lex had fully recovered from the
spell. Suddenly he turned upon Mendacia with a
scathing rebuke, calling her an ugly hag and a terrible
monster.</p>

<p>Mendacia was terribly enraged again, sharp
lines of anger furrowed her face. Fearing for his
companion, Lex caught her arm and they turned
and fled into the house. The woman quickly
followed, and with the help of the serving man
thrust them into a dark room, with a warning that
if they did not obey her their end was near.</p>

<p>Though much frightened, the prisoners barricaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the door as best they could, and tried to plan
a way of escape.</p>

<p>They thought of several schemes but dismissed
them as not being likely to succeed. At last Lex
whispered:</p>

<p>"Oh! Veritas, I know what I shall do!" and
he drew out his pocket knife. "I'll dig through
this floor to the beast's hide and scoop a few handfuls
of leather from his hide, till he shakes the
house off his back!"</p>

<p>At once the boy proceeded to put his words
into action. It was not easy as it seemed, for the
wood of the floor was hard and the knife not very
sharp. But soon Lex found a small crack and set
to work to whittle his way through. For hours
he worked. His hands became so sore that he
had to rest every few minutes and Veritas took
turns at whittling till Lex refused to let her work
any longer.</p>

<p>At last the boy succeeded in making a hole
through which he could easily approach the back
of the monster. It was then midnight, and all was
ready for the last act; but now Lex was too tired to
do more. Both he and Veritas were so weary that
they fell into deep slumber.</p>

<p>Just before the sun rose, the slave sprang out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of bed to begin preparations for breakfast. He
crept into his mistress's room and found that she
was asleep. Then he thought that he would take
a look at the children. He took a candle, carefully
unlocked the door of their prison, opened it a little
way and peered in.</p>

<p>As he looked more closely he saw the knife
still clutched in the boy's hand, and the hole that
the knife had made. At once he knew what the
young prisoners had been trying to do, and he began
to lock the door, so as to keep them confined
till he could give the alarm. But all at once, Lex
awoke, and gazed into the other's eyes. In a
moment the serving man burst into the room and
sprang like a wild cat upon the boy, who scrambled
to his feet and with his knife stabbed the man in
the neck. At this Brutus let go his hold and fled
screaming from the room.</p>

<p>Of course the struggle awoke Veritas and she
slammed the door to and held herself against it,
determined to prevent anyone from entering the
room. The boy resumed his efforts to cut through
the thick hide of the Leviathan.</p>

<p>Mendacia was awakened by her man staggering
into her room, bleeding from a great gash in his
neck. In a few words he told what had happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Mendacia rushed to the prison-room and tried to
enter but the door was held fast. She threw herself
against it again and again.</p>

<p>The monster began to sway back and forth,
and then to thrash the water as the boy dug deeper
and deeper into his vitals. Finally the huge creature
rose clear off the water, shaking himself
violently and wrecking the house completely.
Suddenly, maddened by the pain of his terrible
wound, he made for the bank and from there
scrambled toward the woods carrying what was
left of his burden with him. Trees were broken
down by his rush as he tore on in his mad dash
for freedom. At last he struck an old oak tree
and the fastenings of the house gave way, but still
the monster ran on.</p>

<p>All that night a party of the neighbors had
ridden with the distracted fathers of the children
looking vainly for their dear ones. Toward morning
they heard a terrible noise, and rode with haste
to the spot from which it came, and there they
found the children lying unconscious by an old
deserted house.</p>

<p>They brought their lost ones home, all rejoicing.
When the children told their story, the people
of the village refused to believe them, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had not seen the beast nor his mistress. It was
not until the swimmer who had so narrowly
escaped appeared and confirmed their report of
the Leviathan, that the people credited the story.</p>

<p>The children continued their friendship, and in
due time they were married and had children of
their own, to whom in after years they often told
the tale of the Leviathan.</p>

<h2>THE BROWN FRIAR</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="72" height="75" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A long</span> time ago, where Milwaukee now
stands, on the shore of Lake Michigan,
stood a great forest. The first settlers
were afraid of it, for many strange
animals were said to inhabit the place. Wolves
howled dismally every evening at the setting of
the sun. Some said that the woods were frequented
by goblins.</p>

<p>One evening a peddler appeared in the little
colony. He was given a good dinner and was
much pleased when he was invited to stay all night
at the home of Charles and Betty Townsend.</p>

<p>It was quite an event in the lives of the children
to have a stranger present. They were all curiosity
when the evening meal was over and begged him
to tell them about himself.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the jolly merchant tramp,
"I shall tell you a story that occurred in these very
woods."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried the children. The man
blew his nose in a red handkerchief and continued
his yarn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ten years ago I was making my way home in
a canoe from Canada. I came by way of Sault
Sainte Marie and then along the banks of this lake.
I had been to the Canadian side with my goods,
had sold much to the Indians and made money, and
I was coming home with a bag of money in my
light canoe, and a merry heart. One evening I
took my gun and strolled a short way inland to
shoot a few wild fowl for my supper. I soon succeeded
in shooting a pair of partridge&mdash;for the
woods abounded at that time with much game&mdash;and
was about to return, when I met, face to face,
a curious bird, which resembled a common crow,
except that it was white and with a black topknot.
I raised my gun to shoot so that I might have a better
chance of looking at it, but it flew upon a
neighboring branch, and&mdash;will you believe me?&mdash;it
began to talk!</p>

<p>"'Son of a tramp!' it began, 'thou wasteful
peddler, wouldst thou shoot an innocent bird to
suit thy idle curiosity? Shame! shame!'</p>

<p>"The creature stretched its beak and laughed
in my face, nodding its topknot in mock defiance.</p>

<p>"I stood motionless in sheer fright, but when
the bird jeered at me again, I seized my gun, saying:
'Balaam's ass! I shall teach you respect for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
your superiors! Dare you, that perch every night
upon the stump of a tree, address a decent son of
Adam in terms of scorn? I shall fill you with
shot, pluck your feathers out, tear your tongue
from your head, and throw you to the wolverines.'</p>

<p>"I raised my gun to fire, when the monster bird
spoke again.</p>

<p>"'Shoot, if thou darest, fool! I have beaten
thee in thine argument. Because thou art big as a
moose, strong as Goliath, thou thinkest to put an
end to my arguments by destroying my mortal
body! Thou art no man; thou art a coward, as all
argumentative humans are! Go home and learn
thy A-B-C's! Teach thy grandmother! Tell her
that a pee-wee crow has beaten thee in a debate!'</p>

<p>"'Well, of all things!' thought I, lowering my
gun, and eyeing the impudent thing. 'Who are
you?' I asked. 'Speak! If not, I shall scatter your
brains to the four winds.'</p>

<p>"But the bird merely grinned, turning his head
from side to side, tauntingly.</p>

<p>"'Bang!' I fired, and the report was terrific.
For a while I could not see anything on account of
the smoke, but, when the smoke had cleared away,
I saw beneath the place where the insolent bird had
been, a monk. He was holding the bleeding bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in his arms. Where had he come from? I began
to have cold chills down my back, and worse, remorse
crept into my soul. I turned to flee, but
my boots stuck fast to the earth.</p>

<p>"The monk spoke bluntly, but also very tenderly.
'Sir,' he said, 'thou has wronged thyself!
Thinkest thou this poor bird, whose only fault was
to be in thy angry, inhuman path, has died for
naught? No, my son. Thou hast shot the King
of Crows, and every drop of his blood, and every
feather also, must be sacredly gathered by thee
and brought to me before twelve hours have
passed away.'</p>

<p>"He held to my view the bleeding bird.</p>

<p>"'But,' protested I, 'how can I gather blood
that has already disappeared into the soil? Can
his feathers be gathered&mdash;from where? I do not
know.'</p>

<p>"The monk shook his head sadly. 'Son, it must
be done&mdash;it must be done!'</p>

<p>"In a moment he was gone. I turned to run
away, but I could not move my feet. Then
thought I, 'it is indeed true.'</p>

<p>"That night the shadows themselves became
moving crows, and every noise appeared to be the
voice of the dead bird. I shook with fear. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
woods grew black as ink. The fireflies floated
about, and all nature laughed at me.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I heard the deep baying of wolves.
I seized my gun and stood up. Nearer and nearer
they came.</p>

<p>"'Oh!' I exclaimed, 'am I to perish by their
teeth!'</p>

<p>"Soon I could see the gleam of yellow-red eyes
glaring at me in the darkness. I aimed at the first
one that came near me, and fired. There was a
wild cry, and then the cracking of bones, for the
others at once fell to devouring the wolf I had shot.
Breathlessly I reloaded my double-barreled gun.
In less time than I can tell it, the dead wolf was
gone! Then there was a rush for me. I fired again,
with the same result. Half an hour passed, and
my ammunition gave out. Seizing the muzzle of
my gun, I determined to fight to the end. When
the wolves leaped at me, I sprang back: my feet
were free. With the butt end of the gun, I beat
them off, running backward all the time. Suddenly
my back struck against a tree, and in a
moment I sprang for it. A wolf seized me by the
leg. My trousers ripped, but I scrambled up the
tree!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Charlie, "what about the
monk and the crow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew," answered the peddler, "that someone
would ask that question. Well, to be brief, I
sat on a limb all night&mdash;on the very limb on which
the crow had been sitting. The wolves all the
while were prowling about, and sniffing in the
air, to make sure I was there. Not a bit of sleep
did I get that night, and when the morning came,
I was thankful, for one by one the wolves slunk
off and I was left alone. When all was still again
and things looked safe, my thoughts turned to the
monk's threat, so I got down off my perch, and
crept upon my knees, searching for traces of the
blood and feathers of the crow. I succeeded in
obtaining five little feathers, and these I pocketed
with great care. I gathered up twigs that had any
stains of blood upon them, and stored them away
also. Then I made search under the leaves and
dirt for signs of spilt blood. The leaves I gathered
up, and the ground I sifted for particles of the
precious fluid.</p>

<p>"While I was thus engaged, I heard a voice and
looked up. It was the voice of the monk, saying,
'Hast thou accomplished all thy task?'</p>

<p>"I trembled and made no reply.</p>

<p>"'Thou hast tried, I see, but hast not succeeded
in gathering all. But give me what thou
hast!' he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heaped upon the ground all that I had
gathered, just as if it had been precious gold.</p>

<p>"'There are still five drops of blood and one
feather missing,' said the monk slowly, and a tear
ran down his cheek.</p>

<p>"'Oh, monk,' I cried, 'help me; I shall find
them for you!'</p>

<p>"'No, no, my son; I shall give some of my
own.'</p>

<p>"To my great astonishment, he cut his arm and
let five tiny little drops of blood trickle down upon
the pile of earth. Then he lifted his hand to his
head, as if to extract a hair. Recognizing what
he was about to do, I pulled a bunch of hair out of
my own head, and threw it down. The monk
smiled. Putting his hand beneath his cape, he drew
out the white crow. He placed the crow upon the
pile and clapped his hands. In a second, the crow&mdash;yes,
the same old crow&mdash;hopped up and sat on
the monk's shoulder. Children, I was so pleased
to see that crow, that I cried and begged to be
allowed to go with the monk, but he waved me off
and walked away."</p>

<p>"Oh, peddler," exclaimed Betty. "Did that
really happen in these woods?"</p>

<p>The peddler nodded. "Yes, children, it really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
happened, and the experience changed my whole
life. It is very strange, but whenever I tell this
story, someone soon afterward learns for himself
that it was true."</p>

<p>The children opened their eyes in astonishment.
But their father laughed at them, and
mamma said it was time to go to bed. Very reluctantly
did the youngsters rise and scamper off
to rest. The peddler also went to bed.</p>

<p>When the peddler had gone, Charles and Betty
thought a great deal about what he had told them.
It was Charles who suggested: "Betty, let us go
and search for the monk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Oh!" exclaimed Betty, opening wide her
large blue eyes. "Do you really mean it? But
suppose the monk should see us?"</p>

<p>"Well, and if he did? We have not shot his
birds."</p>

<p>So Betty stared open-eyed while Charlie outlined
his plans. They were to steal away that
afternoon, taking with them their favorite dog,
Don.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over, Charlie and Betty,
attended by Don, struck off into the woods with
light hearts. They took the old, familiar path, over
which they had many a time before played hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and seek. However, it soon vanished into a new
and unknown winding trail. They were delighted
to find a road so easily traveled in the heart of the
wood. Though they did not know it, the path was
really a deer's runway. For at least two long
hours the children wandered, whither they did not
know. At times they would stand and shout, just
to see the squirrels scramble and talk back at them,
and even Don would stretch out his neck and howl
in unison. Occasionally a wild bird scurried away.
Don always gave pursuit.</p>

<p>Suddenly Don cocked up his short ears and
whined. The children looked and saw a few yards
away a little vine-covered hut.</p>

<p>"This is the monk's home, I believe!" whispered
Charlie.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Betty, clapping her hands;
"isn't it fun?"</p>

<p>Don, seeing Betty clap her hands, and beholding
Charlie's face so eagerly looking in the direction
of the hut, thought something strange was
going on, and he lifted up his great head and
barked. The woods rang with his voice, and
Charlie silenced him. They could hear the clatter
of geese and the quack-quack of ducks, but not a
sign of a human being could be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us go closer," whispered Charlie, growing
bolder. Betty nodded, and slowly they crept,
holding onto Don's collar, until they entered a
most beautiful yard. In the center was a large
pond, filled with wild geese, ducks, and all sorts
of fowl. Nothing seemed to be afraid. The
house was one mass of trellis work, ivy green. The
door was open and the children, growing still
bolder, entered. They found a table spread with
flowers and fruits and other things to eat. Don,
without waiting for ceremony, sniffed at a piece
of bacon, and promptly devoured it. He looked
around at the children, licking his chops and grinning.
They were also tempted to partake, but the
stillness made them afraid.</p>

<p>While they were looking at the pretty things
within, they heard a step at the door. They turned
and saw walking toward them a great turkey
gobbler, almost as big as a man.</p>

<p>"Gobble-gobble," said the turkey. Don
bristled up his hairs and growled.</p>

<p>"Gobble-gobble," again began the turkey.
Charlie, summoning courage, spoke up:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Turkey, we are not doing any
harm, and we will go away, if you make room for
us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>But the turkey only drew closer. "Gobble-gobble!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Turkey," began Betty, feeling afraid, for
he looked as if he were going to peck them, "we
have come to see the monk."</p>

<p>The turkey shook his head from side to side,
and again said, "Gobble-gobble." There was no
doubt about his intentions. He meant harm. His
face was scarlet and there lurked an angry fire
in his eyes. He filled the entrance completely.
The gobbler's face swelled bigger and became redder.
His long string nose shot out stiff and
straight. He cleared his throat and yelled,
"Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! OOOO!" It was the
turkey's challenge to fight.</p>

<p>Charlie rushed forward to protect Betty, but
the creature caught him with his great foot and
hurled him back. Don sprang to the rescue, but
almost at once fell back with a great howl and
began to wipe his eyes with his paw. The children
were grief-stricken when they saw that Don had
lost an eye. They looked at the turkey and saw
him in the act of swallowing it. He seemed well
pleased, for he grinned and licked the sides of his
mouth with his red tongue. Charlie rushed the
second time at the gobbler and succeeded in catching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
him by the neck. The bird gave a squawk and
a desperate kick, then tumbled backward and lay
as if dead. The boy fell exhausted on the hard
floor.</p>

<p>Betty ran to the door for help and was delighted
to see a kindly old monk approaching. He
stepped over the monster turkey and entered the
hut. For a long time he stood and looked from
girl to boy as if trying to fathom the whole affair.
Betty could not find courage to say a word.</p>

<p>"Well, well! my dear, this does look serious!"
the monk said.</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Monk, do not be angry, we have
had a terrible time."</p>

<p>"Yes," spoke up Charlie, sitting up, "we did
not mean to disturb your dwelling place. It was
you we were seeking and the turkey attacked us."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Betty, "are you the monk
that met the peddler?"</p>

<p>The monk nodded and Betty clapped her hands
in delight.</p>

<p>"But, dear monk," she asked, "why don't you
chain that horrid gobbler?"</p>

<p>"My dear girl, he is quite harmless, if you are
not afraid of him. If you and Charlie had paid no
attention to him, this afternoon, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
left you alone. The old fellow thinks that he has
the right to guard the place when I am away. If
you are indifferent to his gobbles he believes then
that you must belong to the family. No doubt he
was afraid that you were going to steal something
from the table."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Charlie, "Don did take a
piece of meat, but we could not prevent him."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dears, and poor Don has suffered for
it."</p>

<p>Suddenly the whole trouble became clear.
They had been guilty of stealing as well as Don.
They had desired to take something and had only
been prevented by the appearance of the turkey.
Now as they watched him strutting about the yard&mdash;for
he had scrambled to his feet while they were
talking&mdash;he did not look so fierce. And strange
to say, they understood the meaning of "Gobble."
It was nothing more than, "Vanity and ignorance,
tut and nonsense."</p>

<p>"Come with me," said the good old monk, and
he led the children to the top of the very high hill.
Here he showed them all the great cities of the
East through a large telescope.</p>

<p>It was a very powerful glass for it could bring
into view any place that the looker desired. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
saw their own home. They saw New York and
all the great cities.</p>

<p>"Why are the people trampling on each
other?" inquired Betty.</p>

<p>"Gold, the love of gold. Yet it is not making
them any happier. You can see that. Now take
a look at that woman, Betty."</p>

<p>Betty looked and saw a simply dressed woman
attending to her children. Her face beamed with
pleasure. They looked at another woman, driving
in a carriage, all pampered and bedecked. She
had pain written on her face. She was loaded
down with jewels so that her fingers ached, and
her general appearance was distressful.</p>

<p>"Are all rich people unhappy?" asked Charlie.</p>

<p>"No. Look at the woman I shall show you
now. She is richer than the first one you saw."</p>

<p>They looked and saw a gentle-eyed woman
busy carrying cheer into the poorer haunts of men.
She was a very beautiful as well as a happy
woman.</p>

<p>"Life is not what we have, children, but what
we are. Rich or poor, we can be happy if we do
something for one another."</p>

<p>"Tell us how to be happy without money,"
said the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The monk smiled. "There is but one way."</p>

<p>"What is it?" They eagerly asked.</p>

<p>"Do the thing that is right whenever required,
and do it immediately. For instance, restore the
lost eye to Don."</p>

<p>"But!" they both protested, "how can we&mdash;for
the gobbler swallowed it?"</p>

<p>The monk lowered his voice: "Why not give
one of your eyes to him?"</p>

<p>"I will give my eye, dear Monk!" replied the
boy.</p>

<p>Poor Don stood opposite them, a sorry sight.</p>

<p>"No! No! You will not!" cried Betty. "I will
give mine."</p>

<p>"It must be done by both!" whispered the
monk.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful minute.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" inquired the monk. Charlie
nodded his head and the good man took out a sharp
knife and quickly extracted one eye. The pain
was hard to bear, but the boy never cried. Then
the monk did the same thing to Betty. Both
covered their faces and wept.</p>

<p>Don nosed his way to Charlie and licked his
hands. Charlie peered through his fingers and
saw Don with two whole eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Don!" he exclaimed, forgetting himself
and hugging the old fellow, "I am so glad that you
have two eyes again!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Charlie! Charlie!" exclaimed Betty, "you
have not lost an eye! Have I two eyes?"</p>

<p>To their great amazement, the children found
that they had not lost their eyes at all, but by the
operation could see better than ever.</p>

<p>"Yes," explained the good monk, "do what is
right when you see that it is to be done, and never
think of the pain. Then you will always be
happy."</p>

<p>Then he took the children by the hands and
told them it was time to go home. They did not
want to leave the kind Father, but he assured them
that they could come again. Yes, they came often
and brought others too.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we weren't afraid to give up our eyes
for Don," said Betty, as they were getting ready
for bed that night.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Charlie. "And I'm going to
remember this whenever I feel like being selfish
again: That one doesn't lose anything by trying
to help another."</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
